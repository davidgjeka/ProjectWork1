T'POL:  Previously on Enterprise.
ARCHER: Not the Ambassador.
T'POL: They're clear.
VALDORE: Disconnect the pilot.
ARCHER : There's no reason our people can't become allies.
T'POL : And now, the conclusion.
VRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension  in the region. It's had the opposite effect.
VALDORE: Senator, you have a right
VRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're  working together for the first time in history.
VALDORE: It won't last.
VRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're  presenting a motion to cancel this mission.
VALDORE: That would be a mistake.
VRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you  realise how you've weakened my position?
VALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul.
VRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead.
VALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the  humans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites  together. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two  ships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise  and destroy it.
T'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence.  It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote  location.
SHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it.
T'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many  light years.
REED: So, there really was no one on that ship.
TUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and  sound.
T'POL: Essentially.
TUCKER: Doesn't seem fair.
ARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence?
T'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but  I believe we can construct our own telepresence unit.
TUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship?
T'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their  navigation.
ARCHER: Get started.
T'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained  a brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot.
PHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic.
T'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device.
ARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers.
PHLOX: Not to this extent.
ARCHER: Can you identify the species?
PHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest  genome is Andorian.
NIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the  Bridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array.
VALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew.
NIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot.
VALDORE: What about him?
NIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing.
VALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest.
NIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue.  Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two
VALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants.
NIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be  permanently damaged. He could die.
VALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned  with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission.
NIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission.
VALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship.  After that, his health is of little consequence.
ARCHER: Come in.
SHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the  brain wave pattern.
ARCHER: And?
SHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know.  It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most  of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our  children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the  Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand  the number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face.
ARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder?
SHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few  thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They  don't believe in violence.
ARCHER: One of them does.
SHRAN: It seems that way.
ARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship.
SHRAN: Agreed.
ARCHER:  Travis.
TRAVIS : Yes, sir?
ARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp.
T'POL: You should rest.
TUCKER: I just need a second.
T'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty.
TUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me?
T'POL: It came up in conversation.
TUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The  Captain needs this done fast.
T'POL:  I can manage.
TUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when  it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of  your league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps.  Don't ask me why, they just do.
T'POL: I'll make a note of that.
TUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced  I was going to die. You ever been there?
T'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more  than one occasion.
TUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad  situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have  time to think about it.
T'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty  one, I didn't believe we'd survive.
TUCKER: What went through your mind?
T'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector  array. Why do you ask?
TUCKER: Just curious.
REED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once  you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much  better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you.
SHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of  them.
ARCHER: We're going alone.
REED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people.
ARCHER: That's why we're here. Energise.
SHRAN: Taste that air. Really gets the blood running.
ARCHER:  Twenty eight below?
SHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer.
ARCHER: Yeah.
SHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert  teaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real  strength.
ARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here.
SHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take  advantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was  fifteen.
ARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet.
SHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of  kilometres. Not a good place to get lost.
NIJIL: We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours.
VALDORE: And the pilot?
NIJIL: He's resting.
VALDORE: Will he be ready?
NIJIL: I'll make sure that he is.
VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier.
NIJIL: I'm a scientist.
VALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we  forget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator?
NIJIL: No.
VALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered  him a friend.
NIJIL: What happened?
VALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited  expansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for  our people? And I was expelled.
NIJIL: I'm sorry.
VALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my  experience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never  to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose.
NIJIL: I understand.
VALDORE: Continue with your preparations.
SHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a  chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago.
ARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one.
SHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large  den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body.
ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. We should find another way.
SHRAN: Afraid of heights, Captain?
ARCHER: Shran!
SHRAN: The ice gave out beneath me.
ARCHER: You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still.
ARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start  again.
SHRAN: We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise.
SHRAN: We're well inside the dampening field.
ARCHER: It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar?
SHRAN:  I think we just got a lot closer.
ARCHER: Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt.
LISSAN:  We'll assist you.
PHLOX: There's not as much data on the neural  interface as I'd like.
T'POL: It's all we have.
PHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous.
TUCKER: How dangerous?
PHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic  shock, possibly resulting in brain damage.
TUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer.
PHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid.
T'POL: When can we test it?
PHLOX: A day.
TUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out.
T'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the  unit's effectiveness.
TUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage.
T'POL: I'll test the unit.
TUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky.
T'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable.
TUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back.
T'POL: Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he  returns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's  closed. We have a lot of work to do.
LISSAN: Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own  in a few hours.
SHRAN: My thanks.
LISSAN: You're Captain Archer.
ARCHER: You can read minds.
LISSAN: We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's  thoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian  Chancellor contacted us.
ARCHER: I need to speak with someone in authority.
LISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I  have been chosen as Speaker.
ARCHER: I take it you know why we're here.
LISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been  attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved.
ARCHER: It's a bit more complicated than that.
LISSAN: It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your  thoughts.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
LISSAN: You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets.
ARCHER: Thank you.
LISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict.
SHRAN: That explains a lot.
ARCHER: Shran.
LISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems  there was an Aenar controlling that ship.
ARCHER: But you're sceptical.
LISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could  cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing.
ARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be?
LISSAN: There's one possibility.
SHRAN: Who?
LISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting  ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never  found his body.
SHRAN: Now you know why.
LISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily.
ARCHER: You think he was abducted?
LISSAN: It's the best explanation.
SHRAN: It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped.
LISSAN: This device that you're building aboard your ship.
ARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the  marauder.
LISSAN: You will need one of us to operate it.
SHRAN: You owe us that much, at least.
LISSAN: I'll consult with the others.
TUCKER: Coffee, strong.
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: Hey.
T'POL: Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety.
TUCKER: I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer.
T'POL: I think you're letting your feelings impact your work.
TUCKER: My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go,  they're purely professional.
SHRAN: I've never been able to sleep with someone  standing at the foot of my bed.
JHAMEL:  I didn't mean to disturb you.
SHRAN: Actually, I was awake. What is it?
JHAMEL: I've never met a blueskin.
SHRAN: You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue?
JHAMEL: Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science.
JHAMEL: Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises  above freezing for weeks at a time?
SHRAN: Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds where  the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water.
JHAMEL: I can't imagine such a place.
SHRAN: I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight in  two days.
JHAMEL: I came here to apologise.
SHRAN: For what?
JHAMEL: When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your  thoughts. I didn't intend to.
SHRAN: It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking.
JHAMEL: I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's  missing, he's my brother.
SHRAN: I'm sorry.
JHAMEL: He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally.
SHRAN: So we've been told.
JHAMEL: Do you think he's in pain?
SHRAN: There's no way of knowing.
JHAMEL: I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage.  He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him.
NIJIL: Forgive me.
PHLOX: How do you feel?
T'POL: I just need a moment.
TUCKER: Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc?
PHLOX: So far, so good.
TUCKER: I'll be damned. It's working.
TUCKER: She okay?
PHLOX: Her synaptic response is erratic.
T'POL: I'll be fine.
PHLOX: It's getting worse, Commander.
TUCKER: That's enough. Shut it down!
PHLOX: You're all right.
TUCKER: It worked.
T'POL: I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again.
ARCHER: You said Gareb was abducted. If that's  true, don't you want to help him?
LISSAN: Not with violence.
ARCHER: We're trying to stop violence.
LISSAN: I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our  decision stands.
SHRAN: Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their own  world. We're wasting our time.
NIJIL: Systems ready.
VALDORE: Launch the Drones.
JHAMEL: You need to rest.
SHRAN: I've had enough rest.
ARCHER: We should clear the dampening field soon.
JHAMEL: Wait
SHRAN: What is it?
JHAMEL: A swarm.
SHRAN: I don't see anything.
JHAMEL: It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved  chasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught  hundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very  worried. They're going to be worried about me now.
SHRAN: Are you sure you want to do this?
JHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship?
ARCHER: Warm.
TUCKER: She wants to try again. You think it's smart?
PHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's  doing her job.
TUCKER: She's going to hurt herself.
PHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere.
TUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on  this ship gone crazy?
PHLOX: Not everyone.
TUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy?
PHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in  the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation.
TUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan  neuro-pressure was your idea.
PHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping.
TUCKER: What the hell am I going to do?
PHLOX: This is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. You'll  have to suffer through it.
ARCHER: We've been here before.
JHAMEL: He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us.
ARCHER: How?
JHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface.
LISSAN: It's time to come back.
JHAMEL: I can't.
JHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother.
ARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right.
LISSAN: She's betraying her people.
ARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own  conscience?
ARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was  against your custom.
LISSAN: Jhamel.
JHAMEL: Take my thoughts.
JHAMEL: Yes.
LISSAN: Very well.
ARCHER: Anything on long range sensors?
T'POL: Not yet.
ARCHER: What's our ETA?
T'POL: We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours.
ARCHER: Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners.  If we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shot  counts.
T'POL: Understood.
ARCHER: Report?
TUCKER: She's good to go.
ARCHER: Whenever you're ready.
JHAMEL: I'm ready, Captain.
TUCKER: A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike.
SHRAN: We can stop anytime you like.
JHAMEL: It's strangely enjoyable.
TUCKER: She's maxed it out.
JHAMEL: Is that good?
ARCHER: Very good.
JHAMEL: Is there another test we can try?
TUCKER: We could simulate a course correction.
PHLOX: Synaptic trouble.
SHRAN: Shut it down!
T'POL: I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments.  Nacelle casings. Several bodies, human.
ARCHER: Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature.
T'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay?
ARCHER: She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous to  try again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing.
JHAMEL: What happened?
SHRAN: You had a convulsion. You're all right now.
JHAMEL: I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I?
SHRAN: Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm a  commander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near that  thing.
JHAMEL: Talas was a fortunate woman.
SHRAN: I was the fortunate one.
JHAMEL: My brother is going to die, isn't he?
SHRAN: I won't hear that from you.
JHAMEL: It's hard to be strong.
SHRAN: You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me.
T'POL: A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears to  be a Tellarite freighter.
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines.
T'POL: If it is a freighter.
ARCHER: Anything?
TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres.
ARCHER: Fire.
JHAMEL: What's happening?
SHRAN: We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge.
JHAMEL: Wait. I can feel him.
JHAMEL: Connect me to the device, I need to try again.
JHAMEL: I can reach him. I can make him stop.
SHRAN: Let her try.
NIJIL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage.
VALDORE: Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven.
NIJIL: It may not be necessary.
VALDORE: Follow my orders.
NIJIL: Yes, Admiral.
REED: Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one  six mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: It's power signature is not Andorian.
ARCHER: Target them!
T'POL: Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's the  telepresence unit.
ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. What's going on?
ARCHER: Is she up to it?
PHLOX: She's quite insistent.
PHLOX: Cortical fluctuation. It could trigger a seizure.
SHRAN: Jhamel.
JHAMEL: I can do it.
PHLOX: Disconnect her. Now!
JHAMEL: No!
SHRAN: She can do this.
NIJIL: They've lost warp power.
VALDORE: Continue targeting their engines.
NIJIL: Someone's tapping into the telemetric array.
GAREB: Jhamel?
JHAMEL: It's me.
GAREB: It's not possible. How?
JHAMEL: You have to stop what you're doing.
GAREB: Where are you?
JHAMEL: I'm on the ship you're attacking.
VALDORE: Both Drones are coming to a stop. We're  defenceless.
REED: They've stopped firing.
GAREB: I thought you were dead. They said I was the  last surviving Aenar.
JHAMEL: They lied to you.
GAREB: I've killed so many people.
JHAMEL: It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it.  You know what you have to do.
NIJIL: The first Drone is targeting the second.
VALDORE: Take all weapons offline.
NIJIL: I've lost access.
REED: They're attacking each other.
ARCHER: Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread.
REED: Aye, sir.
VALDORE:  Stop this! Now.
NIJIL: No!
VALDORE: Resume your attack on the Earth ship.
GAREB: Remember me, Jhamel.
JHAMEL: Gareb!
ARCHER: I want to thank you again.
JHAMEL: I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would  have died alone. Goodbye, Captain.
ARCHER: Goodbye.
SHRAN: I regret much of what happened between us recently.
ARCHER: Same here.
SHRAN: When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with  another one. I may not see you for a while.
T'POL: If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf.
SHRAN: I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings.  Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin.
VALDORE: Senator, I assume I'm under arrest.
VRAX: We're both under arrest.
VALDORE: So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye.
NIJIL: The failure is mine, not yours.
VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier.
ARCHER: Come in.
ARCHER: I've been looking over your report. I think you're being a  little hard on yourself.
TUCKER: There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance in  the telepresence emitter.
ARCHER: I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do with  Jhamel's seizure.
TUCKER: But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it.
ARCHER: We were all under a lot of pressure.
TUCKER: My mind wasn't on the job.
ARCHER: If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now.
TUCKER: Captain, I want a transfer.
ARCHER: Where?
TUCKER: Columbia. They need experienced people.
ARCHER: You turned them down twice before. Why now?
TUCKER: I think I can do some good over there.
ARCHER: I need you here, Trip.
TUCKER: They need me more.
ARCHER: What's this really about?
TUCKER: I told you.
ARCHER: I haven't heard one thing that explains this.
TUCKER: I've said everything I want to.
ARCHER: That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse your  transfer?
TUCKER: Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this.
ARCHER: It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you to  stay.
TUCKER: I can't.
ARCHER: All right.
TUCKER: Thank you.
ARCHER: Dismissed.
