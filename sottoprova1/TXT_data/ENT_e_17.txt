ULIS: Kora noosa. Kora noosa!
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.

GRISH:  Irr gnales. Nohm setron quethivoo.
ULIS: NanDi. Vanee eday.

MUK: Krem. Tenda sout  bazul. Ningor. Ningor!
KREM: Oh! Gard-day latinum  sou-tah!
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! 
KREM: Ehj saf-rey tomen-dee.
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon.

MUK: Sa mopree.
MUK: La-voy Daemon.
MUK: Leru deemo mirra.  Mirra.
MUK: Muk lat Ulis.
ULIS: Klaxut.
MUK : Feesha vou dolay.
ULIS: Rejahvey.
TUCKER: Doc, isn't my time up yet? You  said twenty minutes.
TUCKER : It's been at least an hour. I'm  getting a little well-done in here. Doctor?
TUCKER: Hello?
MUK: Sel treoght da-techt.
KREM: Ehj ocuuz sahfi?
MUK: Guzah louz.
MUK: La ruvah tahp!
ULIS: Ingala habi.
ARCHER: Who are you?
ULIS: Ingala duk habi?
ARCHER: I don't understand.
ULIS: Duk habi nakustra?
ARCHER: What?
ULIS: Bok, megoron duk what I'm saying?
MUK: Sit down!
ARCHER: Who the hell are you?
ULIS: Who we are is unimportant. Do you command this ship?
ARCHER: I'm the captain.
ARCHER: What have you done to my  crew?
ULIS: They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
ARCHER: What do you want?
ULIS: Where is the location of your vault?
ARCHER: Vault? I don't know what you're talking about.
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
ULIS: He understands.
ARCHER: This is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship. We don't do  any commerce. Whatever it is you're after, you won't find it here.
ULIS: You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum?
ARCHER: I just told you.
MUK: Liar!
ARCHER: Whoever you are, just take what you want and get off of my  ship.
KREM: Cousin, maybe we should. We've made some good acquisitions  already.
MUK: There's more here. He's hiding something.
GRISH: I agree with Krem. Let's take what we have and go.
ULIS: What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.
ULIS:  Nothing but trinkets.
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their  weight in latinum. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on  Stameris.
ARCHER: Slave market?
ULIS: You're right, Krem. Pick out the females that will bring the best  price.
KREM: I already have.
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
ARCHER: Wait.
ULIS: You've reconsidered?
ARCHER: I'll show you where the vault is, if you let me keep half the  gold.
ULIS: Gold-pressed latinum?
ARCHER: Gold bars. Hundreds of them. But I keep half.
ULIS: Ten percent.
ARCHER: Forty.
ULIS: Fifteen.
ARCHER: Thirty five and not a bar less. You'll never find the vault  without my help.
ULIS: Twenty percent. Final offer.
ARCHER: No deal. I'd rather you take the women and go.
GRISH: Thirty-five percent. That's not a bad offer, Ulis. Maybe we  should consider it.
ULIS: No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start loading the  merchandise.
KREM: Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour?
ULIS: Make him do it.
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
ARCHER: If you're going to make a habit out of this, you might want to  get a bigger ship.
KREM: It's not my ship. It's my cousin's.
ARCHER: Really. I was getting the impression you were in charge.
KREM: This is only my first month on the job.
ARCHER: How do you like it so far?
KREM: My cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a lot from him.  You'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
ARCHER: What do you need all this for, anyway? You seem to already have  plenty of technology.
KREM: One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand  or die'.
ARCHER: Rules of Acquisition?
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I've memorised all a hundred and  seventy three, including the most important one. A man is only worth  the sum of his possessions.
ARCHER: Back on my home world that kind of thinking almost destroyed  our civilisation.
KREM: You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a  lot more moving to do.
ARCHER: We?
ARCHER: So what do you do, split the profits equally between the four  of you?
KREM: Oh, my cousin determines the shares.
ARCHER: You must get a bigger percentage than your crewmates.
KREM: Actually, I get the smallest.
ARCHER: Oh, that doesn't seem fair. You're the one doing all the work.
KREM: My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all my financial  transactions.
ARCHER: Really.
KREM: I don't have the lobes for business.
ARCHER: I assume he charges you for his services.
KREM: Of course.
KREM: He wouldn't  be a very good businessman if he didn't. Never allow family to stand in  the way of profit.
ARCHER: Another one of your rules?
KREM: Number six. My cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some  day.
ARCHER:  Do you think you could bring me a glass of water?
ARCHER: It comes out of a dispenser in the  mess hall.
KREM: I'll be right back.
ARCHER: Oh, do you think you could bring me some food while you're at  it? Whatever's left in the serving case. That is, if you haven't  already taken everything.
TUCKER: You all right, Captain?
ARCHER: Never better. You?
TUCKER: From what I can tell, you and I are the only ones on the ship  still standing. I would've tried to wake some of the others but there's  nothing left in Sickbay to do it with.
ARCHER: I'm not surprised. These aliens are taking everything they can  get their hands on.
TUCKER: Who are they?
ARCHER: I don't know yet. Can you get a phase pistol?
TUCKER: They've cleaned out the armoury.
ARCHER: There are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship. They can't  have emptied every one of them.
TUCKER: Trust me, Captain, I've already checked.
ARCHER: I've got an idea, but you're going to need some help to pull it  off. They used a hypospray to wake me up. It's in Launch bay two.
KREM: This is  pretty good.
ARCHER: Glad you're enjoying it.
KREM: Maybe we should take your cook with us.
ARCHER: Do you mind?
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: You're going to be fine. Just because a guy's in his underwear  you think the worst.
T'POL: I assume you have an explanation.
TUCKER: Doctor Phlox made me clear bio-scan after I got back from that  lunar survey. While I was in decon, something knocked out the entire  crew. Aliens are in control of the ship.
T'POL: That artefact you brought back from the lunar surface. It must  have been placed there intentionally. When I opened it, the canister  released some kind of gas.
KREM: This female is different from the others. What species is she?
ARCHER: She's a Vulcan.
KREM: Vulcan.
ARCHER:They're really not all that  interesting once you get to know them.
KREM: I'd like to get to know this one. Maybe I won't sell her. Not  right away.
ARCHER: Trust me. She's got no sense of humor. She's always  complaining.
ARCHER: Krem.
TUCKER: You okay?
T'POL: There are times I wish Vulcans hadn't learned to repress their  violent tendencies.
TUCKER: Come on, we've got work to do.
T'POL: What about the others?
TUCKER: I can't wake anybody else up. This hypospray is empty. Let's  go, unless you want to be sold into slavery.
MUK: There's nothing  here.
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault. I saw one  just like it on a Gavarian ship.
MUK: Why would they keep a vault in the medical bay?
ULIS: Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing is more  important than your health, except for your money.
MUK: I don't see a locking mechanism.
GRISH: It must use some sort of magnetic seal. I'll need micro-charges  to blow it open.
ULIS: Hold on.
MUK: This is a waste of time. We've only got three hours before they  begin to wake. It'll take days to search every hatch.
ULIS: We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open those.
GRISH : Empty.
MUK : Ah! I found something.
ULIS : Gold?
MUK : No,
MUK: But it looks like quality merchandise.
MUK: Splendid craftsmanship.
ULIS: Add it to the pot.
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in my personal  collection.
ULIS: We agreed to split our profits.
MUK: You said this ship would make us rich. We'll be lucky if we break  even.
ULIS: We had a deal.
MUK: I'm amending it. Anything I find, I keep.
ULIS: Fine. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.
MUK: What's wrong, Ulis? Can't find your pot of  gold?
ULIS: What's all this?
MUK: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't touch.
ULIS: If you're not going to help us you should return to the ship. And  what are you doing?
GRISH: Looking for the vault.
ULIS: They're not going to put it on a map, you idiot.
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm not mistaken these are the  Captain's quarters.
ULIS : So?
GRISH : That's where you keep your latinum.
ULIS: What's the quickest route?
GRISH: We could take this elevator to this deck
GRISH : And cut through here.
ULIS : It's worth a look.
ULIS: Weapons! Where is it coming from?
GRISH: Over here!
GRISH: Make it stop!
ULIS: Let's get to their Captain's quarters.
MUK: Where are my scanners? I left  them right here!
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
MUK: Oh, oh! Open your bag.
ULIS: No.
MUK: Open it.
ULIS: Are you calling me a thief?
MUK: Everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of your own mother's ears.
GRISH: Please, gentlemen. We're partners.
MUK : Partners don't rob from each other.
ULIS : Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners?
MUK: Worthless?
ULIS: I didn't put them there.
MUK: Oh, really? Then who did?
ULIS: I tell you, I don't know.
MUK: Maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled inside. Where's  the other one? There were three.
GRISH: Don't look at me.
MUK: Give it back.
GRISH: Get away.
MUK: Come back here!
MUK : You heard me, you no-good cheating liar!
KREM: There. That one.
ARCHER: I'm surprised your friend didn't get electrocuted. You can't  just yank out an antimatter injector like it was a light bulb.
KREM: Would you mind?
ARCHER: I'll have to take the injector assembly offline.
KREM: Warp core parts are in high demand.
ARCHER: Even if your cousin does find the vault, what makes you think  he's going to share the gold with you?
KREM: We have a contract.
ARCHER: If you never see the vault, you'll never know what's in it. He  could try to cheat you out of your share.
KREM: He wouldn't cheat me.
ARCHER: What happened to 'Never allow family to stand in the way of  profit'? I've seen the way the others treat you. One of them said you  have no talent for business. Why not prove them wrong? I've got a  proposition for you. Help me capture your associates and I'll show you  where the vault is. We'll split the gold, fifty-fifty. Once they're in  the Brig you can fly off a wealthy man. You said you've always dreamed  of having your own ship.
KREM: How do I know you won't double-cross me?
ARCHER: You're the one holding the gun. Think about it. No more taking  orders, getting stuck with the menial work. I'll even throw in the  Vulcan female. So, what'll it be? Opportunities like this don't come  along every day.
KREM: Get back to work.
ARCHER: It's your loss.
GRISH: Where is the vault? Do you understand me?
GRISH: I can't lock on to its language.
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you fool. Probably the captain's next meal.
GRISH: Don't be so sure. Look at the size of its ears.
MUK: Ooo, I could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the  Malurzian Zoo.
ULIS: There's nothing here. Let's search the other quarters.
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You two have fun.
MUK: Who's there?
MUK:  One of the aliens is awake.
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep?
ARCHER: What's next?
ARCHER: Where do you expect me to put it? There's hardly any room left  on your ship. I think it's time you decided what you really want to  keep.
KREM: I'll ask Ulis.
ARCHER: Can't you make a simple decision by yourself? If you want to  run your own ship someday, maybe you should start showing a little  initiative.
KREM: I'm not the one in charge.
ARCHER: And you never will be, with that attitude.
ULIS: Who's this?
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer.
ULIS: Why is he awake?
ARCHER: Don't ask me.
ULIS: Are there others?
ARCHER: I haven't seen anybody.  You?
GRISH: The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two  hours. Maybe we used the wrong dosage. There could be others awake. We  should leave.
ULIS: Not without the gold.
MUK: Forget the gold. We'll never find it.
ULIS: If you want to leave, take one of their shuttlecraft. I'll be  happy to keep your share.
MUK: You expect me to go empty-handed?
ULIS: You can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females.
MUK: That's not good enough.
ULIS: It'll have to be.
MUK: You'll regret this, Ulis.
ULIS: Get out.
MUK: Grish, help me with the women.
TUCKER: Wait. I'll show you the vault.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Leave the women here, and I'll let you have the gold.
ARCHER: Not another word, Commander. That's an order.
TUCKER: I'm not letting them take my wife.
ULIS: Wife?
KREM: She's not the one with the pointy ears, is she?
TUCKER: No. Her name's Hoshi, and you're going to keep your filthy  hands off her. Do we have a deal?
ARCHER: You take them anywhere near that vault, and I'll throw you in  the Brig for insubordination.
TUCKER: You don't give a damn about this crew. All you care about is  your precious gold.
ARCHER: I'm warning you, Trip.
TUCKER: You're a greedy son of a bitch.
ARCHER: What's your wife worth? Five bars of gold, maybe six? Let them  take Hoshi, and I'll give you ten.
TUCKER: What!
ARCHER: All right, fifteen.
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
TUCKER: You'll leave the women?
ULIS: You have my word as a businessman.
TUCKER: Follow me.
ULIS: Wait here. I'll go.
MUK: So you can cheat us out of our share? Hide it in the bottom of  your bag? I plan to count every bar of that gold myself before it  leaves the vault.
ULIS: We'll count it later.
MUK: Oh, I know you too well, Ulis.
GRISH: If he's going, I'm going.
KREM: Me, too.
ULIS: We can't all go. Time's running out. Someone has to stay and  finish loading the ship.
GRISH: That's Krem's job.
KREM: I'm tired of doing this job. I don't want to do all the menial  work.
ULIS: Krem.
KREM: It's time that I showed a little initiative. I have the lobes for  business. You just never give me the chance to prove it.
ULIS: Get back to work!
KREM: Yes, cousin.
ARCHER: You sure told him.
KREM: Get back to work.
ARCHER: My back.
KREM: What about it?
ARCHER: I think I pulled a muscle. It's an old water-polo injury.  Flares up every now and then. I just need to rest.
KREM: We don't have any time. If Ulis comes back and we're not  finished.
ARCHER: Then you'd better get working.
ULIS: Where are we going?
TUCKER: Bottom deck.
MUK: We already looked there.
TUCKER: You obviously didn't look in the right place.
ULIS: After you.
T'POL: Have you come to rescue me?
KREM: How did you wake up?
T'POL: Whatever put the others to sleep didn't affect me in the same  way. My body works differently than the humans.
KREM: Humans?
T'POL: That's the name of their species. They're a terrible race.  Deceitful, cruel.
KREM: Then why do you live with them?
T'POL: It wasn't my choice. I'm a captive here. They've enslaved me.  Please, take me with you.
KREM: You would make a handsome wife. Do you know how to perform  oo-mox?
T'POL: I'm well-trained in the arts of pleasure, but I'm not familiar  with oo-mox.
KREM: My lobes. Stroke my lobes.
T'POL: Like this?
KREM: Yes.
T'POL: And this?
KREM: Oh, yes!
ULIS: Haven't we been through this section?
TUCKER: Not yet.
ULIS: I recognise that conduit.
TUCKER: We have a thousand conduits like that on this ship.
MUK: We're going in circles.
TUCKER: This way.
GRISH: Isn't there a more direct route?
TUCKER: That's the beauty of this thing. It's impossible to find unless  you know exactly where you're going.
ULIS: How much further?
TUCKER: Keep your shirt on. It's close.
TUCKER: Watch your head.
MUK: Is this your plan, to walk us to death?
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
TUCKER: Relax. We're here.
GRISH: The vault?
TUCKER: It's all yours.
ULIS: Open it. Open it!
TUCKER: Better let me go in first.
ULIS: Why?
TUCKER: Knowing Captain Archer, he's probably rigged the place with  booby traps. Just give me a few minutes to check it out.
MUK: No! You could have a weapon hidden in there.
ULIS: I'll go.
MUK: Not without me, you won't. You'll fill your pockets with gold.
ULIS: Take your hands off me!
GRISH: We don't have all day.
ULIS: Get away from that hatch! Out of my way!
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
ULIS: It's mine!
MUK: Get back, or I'll gnaw your hands off!
GRISH: My gold! My gold!
ULIS: It's a trap!
TUCKER: Sorry fellas, bank must be closed today.
ARCHER: Did it work?
T'POL: Perfectly.
ARCHER: Do you have the key?
T'POL: Not that interesting. No sense of humour. Always complaining.
ARCHER: I'll make it up to you.
T'POL: How?
ARCHER: Five bars of gold? Open these things, Sub-Commander. That's an  order.
ARCHER: Yeah, Porthos. You okay?
ARCHER: I'm going to be contacting the Vulcan High  Command as well as Starfleet. If you come within a light year of any  one of our ships you won't know what hit you.
KREM: You'll never see us again.
ARCHER: If you want to be unshackled, you might think about showing  Krem here a little more respect.
MUK: Vermin.
ULIS: Release me, and I'll forget this ever happened.
KREM: Later, maybe. If you're nice.
ULIS: Let me go, you idiot!
KREM: Shut up!  Are you sure you want to stay here with the  hu-mans? With my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune.
ULIS: I'll let you have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your  eye on.
KREM: No thanks.
ULIS: My beetle-snuff collection.
KREM: Makes me sneeze.
ULIS: Name your price.
GRISH: Whatever he offers you, I'll double it.
ULIS: Krem! We're family.
MUK: I know a Bolian female. I could introduce you.
