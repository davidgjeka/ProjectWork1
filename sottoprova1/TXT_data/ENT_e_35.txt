ARCHER : Archer to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER : I know you're off duty, but we've got visitors.
TUCKER: I can see that.
ARCHER : Are you up for a little repair work?
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER : Meet me at Docking Port two.
TUCKER: On my way.
TUCKER: Anything serious?
ARCHER: They said they were having trouble with one of their life  support systems.
TUCKER: Who's they?
T'POL: Retellian cargo pilots. The seal is secure.
ARCHER: Welcome aboard.
GOFF: Gracious of you to help us, Captain. We were beginning to think  our distress call would never be answered.
ARCHER: This is Sub-Commander T'Pol and my Chief Engineer, Commander  Tucker.
PLINN: Our salvation.
TUCKER: The Captain said something about life support.
GOFF: We were hired to return a young woman to her home world. A few  days ago her stasis pod began to malfunction.
ARCHER: Stasis? Is she injured?
GOFF: No, no. She's a passenger, but our ship is designed to haul  cargo, not people and it's a very long journey. Putting her in  suspended animation was our only choice.
PLINN: We have another five months ahead of us. If she wakes up there  won't be enough food, air to breathe. If we're forced to abort the  mission we won't get paid.
T'POL: Commander Tucker is resourceful. I'm sure he'll be able to  assist you.
TUCKER: Mind if I have a look?
PLINN: Please.
GOFF: You've been very accommodating. If it's not too much trouble I'd  like to make another request. It's been a long time since we've enjoyed  the luxury of a bath.
ARCHER: I understand. T'Pol will show you to guest quarters. When  you're done, I'll have my chef prepare you a meal.
PLINN: This regulates power flow to the biopod.
TUCKER: Looks very creative.
PLINN: These relays are from an old Ardanan shuttle. They weren't  designed to carry this much current.
TUCKER: I've got some EPS conduits that might do the trick.
TUCKER: This would be a lot easier if I could read your language. If  you don't mind, I'd like to ask our Communications Officer to give me a  hand.
PLINN: By all means.
PLINN: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: No. No, no problem. I'm going to need some tools from  Enterprise. With a little luck, Sleeping Beauty here will never know  there was a problem.
ARCHER: Come in.
GOFF: I hope I didn't deplete your water supply.
ARCHER: I'm sure we'll manage. Please.  T'Pol tells me your  vessel can't do much better than warp two.
GOFF: Warp two point two.
ARCHER: I've been making some calculations. If I'm not mistaken, at  warp four point five Enterprise can have you at your destination in  less than four days.
GOFF: That's a generous offer, but I've already inconvenienced you far  too much.
ARCHER: It's no inconvenience. We're out here to meet new people.  You're heading toward an inhabited world we've never seen. First  contacts tend to go more smoothly when a familiar face is making the  introductions.
GOFF: I'm sure you'll do fine on your own.
ARCHER: You could dock in our launch bay. You wouldn't have to worry  about that stasis pod. We have plenty of room for you and your  passenger.
GOFF: It's not that simple, Captain. This has all been carefully  prearranged. Her family's not expecting her for another five months.  They're not even on her home world at the moment. But I will accept  your offer of a meal, if it's not too late.
HOSHI: Commander? Hello?
TUCKER: Is that the translation?
HOSHI: Give or take an adverb.
TUCKER: Thanks.
HOSHI: At least you don't have to work alone.
TUCKER: Hell of a way to travel, isn't it?
HOSHI: Who is she? Any idea?
TUCKER: I asked Plinn but he doesn't seem to know too much about her.  He said something about studying medicine in a research colony.
HOSHI: A doctor?
TUCKER: I suppose so. She must have a real passion for it if she's  willing to go through all this. Shame we'll never get to meet her.
HOSHI: It's not polite to stare, Commander.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
HOSHI: Let me know if you have any problems with that translation.
TUCKER: I wasn't staring.
TUCKER: Hoshi?
TUCKER: Are you all right?
ARCHER: Problem?
GOFF: The stasis pod.
T'POL: What about it?
GOFF: It's malfunctioning. If you'll excuse me, Captain.
T'POL: I'll show you to the docking port.
GOFF: I know the way.
GOFF: What are you doing?
TUCKER: Help me open this thing!
GOFF: We can't bring her out of stasis.
TUCKER: She's suffocating!
TUCKER: The release is jammed. Don't bother.
TUCKER: I'm sorry about this, but the O2 recycler went offline.
KAITAAMA: Dulsha tot!
TUCKER: You're going to be all right.
KAITAAMA: Kosh vos!
PLINN: Yes?
GOSS : There's a minor problem. I'm going to need your assistance.
PLINN: What kind of problem?
GOSS : The malfunction is more complicated than I expected.
PLINN: I'll be there in a moment. I don't mean to be rude.
ARCHER: Not at all. Archer to Commander Tucker. Trip, can you hear me?   Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Mister Plinn?
PLINN:  That's right.
REED: Lieutenant Reed. The Captain asked me to escort you back to your  ship.
PLINN: That won't be necessary.
REED: I'm afraid I'm under orders.
PLINN: Have I done something wrong?
REED: It's just a precaution.
PLINN: I never realised leaving the Captain's table would cause so much  concern.
REED: He's trying to break loose.
ARCHER: Secure the docking clamps.
ARCHER: Report.
TRAVIS: He hasn't gotten far at warp two, sir.
ARCHER: Hail him.
HOSHI: No response.
ARCHER: Phase cannons. Target his engines.
REED: Direct hit to the port nacelle. He's dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Bring us into grappling range. Hail him again.
TRAVIS: Captain.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Dilithium hydroxls. Ionised pyrosulfates.
TRAVIS: He's moving off.
ARCHER: Stay with him.
ARCHER: I thought you took out one of his nacelles?
REED: So did I.
TRAVIS: Our warp drive won't engage.
REED: That cloud he released, it got into the plasma vents. They'll  have to be purged.
TRAVIS: He's moving out of sensor range. I've lost him.
KAITAAMA: Tuvat at.
TUCKER: What the hell did you do that for?
KAITAAMA: Tuvat at.
TUCKER: Hold on. Hold on. I'm not working with them.
KAITAAMA: Luvasta eeva. Destas.
TUCKER: Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm, I'm from a starship  called Enterprise. Enterprise. Now put that thing down and I'll untie  you. Your hands, I'll free your hands. Let me help you.
KAITAAMA: Has trava dukla.
TUCKER: What the hell's going on?
GOSS: Is it repaired?
TUCKER: What?
GOSS: The stasis pod.
TUCKER: Where's Captain Archer?
GOSS: Your ship is a long way from here.
KAITAAMA: Slovasa toraya.
GOSS: Repair the pod so we can put her back in stasis.
TUCKER: It's going to take a few hours.
GOSS: Work quickly.
KAITAAMA: Am sotey.
TUCKER: You're welcome?
KAITAAMA: Tule bas?
TUCKER: Have you seen a little device? It's about this big, has a  keypad on it. It's my Universal Translator. It'll help us understand  each other.
KAITAAMA: Has nos?
TUCKER: That's it. It's just so we can talk.
TUCKER: I need you to say something. You got to keep talking.
KAITAAMA: Votni vay, atayun ponas.
TUCKER: A little more.
KAITAAMA: Akasa jorat. Foraya nuratay. fegasa ana a'hanjura.
TUCKER: Can you understand me?
KAITAAMA: Serotta jho.
TUCKER: Where's Hoshi when you need her?
KAITAAMA: Who is Hoshi?
TUCKER: That's better. Would you mind telling me what's going on here?
KAITAAMA: How long have I been in stasis?
TUCKER: You'd have to ask them.
TUCKER: Commander Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you hear me?
KAITAAMA: You are an officer?
TUCKER: Chief Engineer. Feels like we've gone to warp.
KAITAAMA: Explain yourself. What do you know about my abductors?
TUCKER: We thought they were cargo pilots. They claimed you were their  passenger.
KAITAAMA: I am their prisoner. I was returning from a diplomatic  mission when they attacked my transport, murdered my guards. You don't  know who I am, do you?
TUCKER: Should I?
KAITAAMA: My family is known on hundreds of worlds.
TUCKER: Well, I'm afraid Earth isn't one of them. So I take it you're  not a doctor.
KAITAAMA: I am First Monarch of the Sovereign Dynasty of Krios Prime.
TUCKER: Oh. Charles Tucker the third. Please to meet you. So what do  these guys want?
KAITAAMA: Ransom. No doubt they'll demand a high price for my safe  return.
TUCKER: Listen, my Captain'll be looking for me. All we have to do is  get off this ship and let him know where we are.
KAITAAMA: And how do you propose we do that?
TUCKER: I saw a shuttlebay earlier. There were a couple of escape pods.
KAITAAMA: You're not going anywhere.
TUCKER: I beg your pardon?
KAITAAMA: We'll remain here until they contact the Sovereign Guard.  Once the ransom has been paid, we'll be released.
TUCKER: Well, if it's all the same to you I'd rather take my chances in  open space.
KAITAAMA: It's too dangerous. If you leave, it would provoke them.
TUCKER: If I remember right this access tube leads to a junction near  the shuttlebay.
KAITAAMA: You are not to leave this chamber.
TUCKER: With all due respect, I'm not one of your subjects.
ARCHER: He's your partner. You must have some idea  where he's going.
PLINN: Obviously, I'm his victim as well. Why else would he leave me  here?
T'POL: Where were you taking your passenger?
PLINN: Goff had the coordinates.
ARCHER: You don't even know what system you were heading for?
PLINN: It wasn't my responsibility. He was piloting the ship, not me. I  spent most of my time looking after the cargo. Believe me, Captain I'm  as eager to find my partner as you are.
ARCHER: If that's true, then we could work together to track him down.
PLINN: I don't see how.
ARCHER: We've got pretty good long range sensors, but your ship could  be anywhere within a half dozen light years. It'd be a lot easier if we  knew your warp frequency.
PLINN: Well, I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I know very little  about warp engines.
ARCHER: Take him back to Docking Port Two. Put him in the airlock and  post a security detail.
PLINN: I'm telling you the truth!
ARCHER: We'll keep the outer hatch unlocked. If you decide to leave,  you know the way out.
TUCKER: Could you hand me that circuit probe? The one with the green  handle?
TUCKER: You must be one hell of a diplomat.
KAITAAMA: Is your entire species so ill-mannered?
TUCKER: No, just me.
KAITAAMA: You know, if you were thinking rationally you'd be repairing  that stasis pod. He did threaten to kill you.
TUCKER: That's precisely why I'm getting out of here. I really doubt  they're going to keep me around once I fix their problem. You know, I  realise someone in your position isn't used to taking advice from a guy  like me, but I strongly suggest you come along.
KAITAAMA: He'd never harm me. I'm too valuable to them.
TUCKER: I've been involved in a few hostage situations. They rarely  turn out the way you expect.
KAITAAMA: You're correct, Mister Tucker. I don't take advice from  people like you.
TUCKER: You know, that stasis pod won't fix itself. Chances are you're  going to spend the next five months tied up in this grimy little cargo  hold. Not exactly my idea of a royal voyage.
KAITAAMA: I'll be fine.
TUCKER: When I get back to Enterprise I'll make sure we get a message  to your homeworld. Krios?
KAITAAMA: Krios Prime.
TUCKER: Take care.
KAITAAMA: Once you launch an escape pod what makes you think they won't  destroy it?
TUCKER: I'm going to reroute their internal sensors. I'll be a million  kilometres away before they know I'm gone. I'm much better company.
KAITAAMA: How much farther?
TUCKER: Just a few more metres.
KAITAAMA: Are you sure this is the right direction?
TUCKER: Keep your voice down. What am I supposed to call you, anyway?  First Monarch? Your Highness?
KAITAAMA: Kaitaama.
TUCKER: What is that? Some kind of a title?
KAITAAMA: It's my name.
KAITAAMA: What are you doing?
TUCKER: These lead to internal sensors.
TUCKER: We don't have all day.
KAITAAMA: This is meant for one person.
TUCKER: We'll have to make do. Unless you know how to fly one of these  things.
KAITAAMA: What was that?
TUCKER: We're crossing the subspace threshold.
TUCKER: That wasn't so bad.
KAITAAMA: What do you propose we do next?
TUCKER: To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it.
KAITAAMA: I assumed you had a plan.
TUCKER: I was only joking. They do have a sense of humour where you  come from?
KAITAAMA: Among the commoners. Only joking.
TUCKER: It's only a matter of time before they realise we're gone. No  doubt they'll come about and look for us. We need a place to hide.
KAITAAMA: Where?
TUCKER: If I'm translating this right, there's a system about ninety  million kilometres from here. We should be able to reach it in a day or  so.
KAITAAMA: What makes you think any of those planets are habitable?
TUCKER: Only one way to find out. Permission to set a course, your  Sovereignty?
KAITAAMA: Proceed.
TUCKER: Look, this would be a whole lot easier if you'd stop moving  around.
KAITAAMA: You're touching me.
TUCKER: I'm afraid I don't have much choice.
KAITAAMA: It's inappropriate to touch the First Monarch.
TUCKER: You're welcome to step outside until I'm done. Excuse me.
TUCKER: There we go. Landing thrusters, No, wait, they're stabilisers.
KAITAAMA: You have no idea how to control this vehicle.
TUCKER: I'm working on it.
KAITAAMA: Even if we do find a breathable atmosphere and you manage to  land without killing us, what will we do about food? Water? There could  be hostile lifeforms on the surface. How will we protect ourselves?
TUCKER: Look, I've got less than twenty four hours to figure out how to  scan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language I  don't understand, and I'm not going to get it done with you  interrupting me every five seconds. So I'd appreciate it if you'd keep  quiet until I'm finished. Now, lift your butt.
KAITAAMA: My what?
TUCKER: Your behind, your rear end. I haven't checked that panel yet.
KAITAAMA: Quickly.
TUCKER: You know, you were a lot more pleasant in stasis.
TUCKER: I think I found the landing thrusters. I understand how  difficult this must be for someone of your upbringing, but we could be  stuck out here for awhile. We should find a way to get along. I'm  willing to give it a try if you are.
KAITAAMA: My hand. You're sitting on my hand. I'll try.
REED: The prisoner, sir, as ordered.
ARCHER: Thank you.
REED: Will there be anything else, Captain?
ARCHER: Not right now, Lieutenant. Dismissed.
ARCHER: Have a seat.
PLINN: Why have I been brought here?
ARCHER: Sit down.
PLINN: I already told you everything I know.
ARCHER: We're not here to talk about your partner. We're here to talk  about you.
PLINN: What about me?
ARCHER: You're facing some very serious charges, Mister Plinn. Where we  come from criminals are held accountable for their actions. If they're  found guilty, they're punished. This is where your tribunal is going to  take place.
PLINN: Tribunal?
PLINN: I am not subject to your laws.
ARCHER: That's not for me to decide.
ARCHER: Starfleet asked the Vulcan High Command to assign a judicial  administrator to Enterprise. Someone who wouldn't be swayed by human  emotion. Someone objective, logical. From what I understand,  Sub-commander T'Pol has already reviewed the evidence. This tribunal is  nothing more than a formality. I thought you should be prepared. Her  punishments can be severe.
PLINN: How severe?
ARCHER: If you're late for your shift you might receive a beating. But  for more grievous offenses, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming an  officer. We started out with eighty three crewmen on board. We're down  to seventy six.
PLINN: But I haven't done anything wrong.
ARCHER: Accessory to kidnapping, resisting arrest, obstruction of an  investigation, causing damage to a Starfleet vessel.
PLINN: What damage?
ARCHER: When your partner fled he released a cloud of dilithium  hydroxls that clogged our plasma vents.
PLINN: I had nothing to do with that.
ARCHER: As I said, I'm not the one you have to convince.
ARCHER: Sub-commander.
T'POL: Has the accused been informed of the charges?
ARCHER: Yes, ma'am.
T'POL: How much do you weigh?
PLINN: What?
T'POL: Your weight.
PLINN: Seventy two kilograms.
T'POL: Height?
PLINN: One point eight metres. Why are you asking these questions?
T'POL: Does your culture observe any postmortem rituals?
PLINN: This is not fair. I demand to speak with someone from my  government.
ARCHER: He's got a point. We've never tried an alien before. Maybe we  should contact the High Command.
T'POL: They've granted me complete autonomy in these matters. If I had  to consult my superiors every time I made a ruling it would defeat my  purpose here. We'll convene at eighteen hundred hours.
ARCHER: As you wish.
PLINN: You can't allow this.
ARCHER: There's nothing I can do.
PLINN: But you're the Captain.
ARCHER: She owes me a few favours. I can't promise anything but I, I'd  be willing to ask for leniency. Of course, I'd want something in  return. We still haven't found a way to locate your vessel. If you  could remember that warp frequency.
KAITAAMA: Are there any provisions? I'm hungry.
TUCKER: You might check that storage compartment above your head.
KAITAAMA: You do it.
TUCKER: I'm busy.
TUCKER: If you find any water up there, I could use some.
TUCKER: Thanks.
TUCKER: Allow me.
TUCKER: I'm not contagious.
KAITAAMA: Is it edible?
TUCKER: Depends how hungry you are.
TUCKER: It reminds me of my first car.
KAITAAMA: Car?
TUCKER: A four-wheeled vehicle. Wasn't much bigger than this. All we're  missing is the ocean breeze coming off the Gulf. I used to drive out to  a place called Chatkin Point, park along the shoreline and stare at the  moon with my girlfriend. Don't worry. I won't make a pass at you.
KAITAAMA: The Sovereign Guard would cut off one of your hands.
TUCKER: You must be a fun date.
KAITAAMA: The First Monarch doesn't socialise with the opposite sex.
TUCKER: You've never been on a date?
KAITAAMA: Four years ago, before I was selected to ascend to First  Monarch, I was courted by young men from many noble families. Now I  spend my personal time in the company of my father's advisors.
TUCKER: Sounds kind of lonely.
KAITAAMA: You haven't finished your work.
KAITAAMA: It's all water.
TUCKER: There's a chain of islands near the equator.
KAITAAMA: Will we be able to breathe?
TUCKER: Oxygen, nitrogen, a trace of methane. Nothing we can't handle.
KAITAAMA: Do you detect any lifeforms?
TUCKER: If I could figure out how to use the bio-sensors.
KAITAAMA: Are you certain we have the correct planet?
TUCKER: It's the only one with an atmosphere.
KAITAAMA: You may begin our descent.
TUCKER: Let's hope I get this right.  We're entering the  thermosphere. The port stabiliser's down.
KAITAAMA: Can you repair it?
TUCKER: No, but the starboard one should keep us on course. 
KAITAAMA: Mister Tucker!
TUCKER: So far so good. Eight thousand metres. I think they're metres.  Seven thousand. I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing. Five  thousand metres. You might want to grab hold of something.
TUCKER: Two thousand metres. One thousand. Hold on.
TUCKER: You all right?
KAITAAMA: What is that?
TUCKER: Damned if I know.
KAITAAMA: This heat is unbearable.
TUCKER: It's nothing compared to a summer in the Everglades. At least  there aren't any mosquitoes.
KAITAAMA: Where are we going?
TUCKER: Over there. Looks like a good place to set up camp.
KAITAAMA: Your vessel will never find us here.
TUCKER: Don't underestimate Captain Archer.
KAITAAMA: You're bleeding.
TUCKER: It's just a scratch.
KAITAAMA: Remove your uniform.
TUCKER: I'll take care of it later.
KAITAAMA: We have no idea what microbes live in this environment. It  could become infected.
TUCKER: I said later.
KAITAAMA: You're my only hope of surviving here, Mister Tucker. I don't  intend to let you die.
TUCKER: This one.
KAITAAMA: Hold still. The provisions won't last for more than a day.
TUCKER: It sounds like there's plenty of wildlife. I grew up in a place  kind of like this. I don't think we're going to starve. And I can use  the thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire, boil some water.  Thanks.
KAITAAMA: You're welcome.
TUCKER: That's the best you could do?
KAITAAMA: There's very little dry wood.
TUCKER: Keep looking.  What are you waiting for?
KAITAAMA: I'm not your servant. You're the one who was raised in a  primitive environment. You find the wood.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
KAITAAMA: You're obviously better suited to physical labour.
TUCKER: In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a palace. You said it  yourself. You won't survive without my help, so it seems to me that I'm  the one in charge. The king of the swamp. Now get your ass out there  and don't come back without an armful of dry wood.
KAITAAMA: I should have you imprisoned for speaking to me that way.
TUCKER: You should give me a medal. You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
KAITAAMA: I'm beginning to think that would be preferable.
TUCKER: I doubt the commoners back home would complain.
KAITAAMA: How dare you!
TUCKER: You're the one who took a swing at me.
KAITAAMA: You insulted the First Monarch!
TUCKER: I'm just a petty commoner, remember? Raised on a primitive,
KAITAAMA: What's wrong?
TUCKER: A homing beacon. Unless I'm way off, someone just locked on to  it.
KAITAAMA: Your vessel?
TUCKER: No way to tell.
KAITAAMA: Leave him.
TUCKER: Let's find his weapon.
KAITAAMA: There's someone else here.
ARCHER: Trip?
ARCHER: This a bad time?
TUCKER: So, when do you ascend?
KAITAAMA: Two hundred and forty six days.
TUCKER: It's a long shot, but maybe Enterprise will get the chance to  visit Krios Prime before then. Of course, from what you've told me I  doubt your family would let me see you.
KAITAAMA: I doubt they would, but once I've been made First Monarch  I'll have the authority to change the rules.
TUCKER: What kind of changes?
KAITAAMA: Come visit me. Perhaps you'll find out.
