ARCHER: Morning everyone.
ALL: Morning, sir.
ARCHER: What have we got today?
T'POL: We've detected several phenomenon. A J'ral class supernova  remnant approximately three light years off our course.
ARCHER: That's interesting. What else?
T'POL: A cluster of three neutron stars. Very unusual.
TUCKER: How about that, three stone-cold stars. Pretty exciting, huh?
ARCHER: Anything else?
TUCKER: There is one other thing that might be worth swinging by to  take a look. A Minshara class planet about four and a half light years  away.
ARCHER: Any life signs?
TUCKER: Only about five hundred million. If our scans are right, it  looks like there's a whole civilisation down there.
ARCHER: You might have put that  on the top of the list.
ARCHER: Put us into orbit at five hundred  kilometres.
REED: I'm not picking up any other ships or satellites.
TRAVIS: Should we hail them?
HOSHI: Who? I'm picking up dozens of cities on each continent.
ARCHER: Let's hold off a second. We don't know whether they're using  high-band frequencies or smoke signals.
T'POL: The latter's more likely. I'm not detecting any EM  transmissions.
TUCKER: Pre-industrial?
ARCHER: Let's take a closer look.
ARCHER: Do  you see that, just off the coast.
HOSHI: I've got it.
TUCKER: Looks like an old clipper ship.
ARCHER: It's almost like travelling back in time.
TUCKER: I cannot wait to get down there.
T'POL: I'd advise against that. It's standard protocol to wait until a  society develops warp drive before initiating first contact.
TUCKER: Those are Vulcan protocols, not human.
T'POL: Starfleet would be wise to adopt them. There's no way to know  how our arrival would affect the evolution of their society.
TUCKER: So what are you suggesting we do?
T'POL: Our sensors can gather a great deal of data from orbit.
ARCHER: Give me a tighter view of the city, Hoshi.
ARCHER: Can you get tight enough to see their faces?
ARCHER: Freeze that. They  don't look so different. What do you think, Trip?
TUCKER: I think you're right, Captain.
T'POL: You'd be recognised immediately as outsiders.
ARCHER: Not if we look like them. Starfleet could've sent a probe out  here to make maps and take pictures, but they didn't. They sent us so  we could explore with our own senses.
ARCHER: You okay?
HOSHI: The acoustic relay is picking up dozens of languages. I could  spend the next ten years studying this place.
ARCHER: Well, let's hear some of it.
HOSHI: It'll take a while to work out a translation matrix for all of  them. We'll be able to narrow it down for you once we pick a landing  site. I did find the one word you might want to remember. Akaali. It's  the name of their species.
ARCHER: A farm?
T'POL: It's remote and sparsely populated. If you're exposed, there's a  reduced risk of cultural contamination.
ARCHER: This must be why aliens are always landing in cornfields. So,  who do we send first?
PHLOX: It should stand up to scrutiny as long as  you don't look too close. Here, see for yourself.
HOSHI: It itches.
PHLOX: You mustn't touch it, Ensign. The irritation will subside.
HOSHI: Are you sure I'm the right person for this?
ARCHER: If the translator goes down, you'll be able to handle yourself  better than any of us.
PHLOX: The anterior crests aren't quite symmetrical. I'll just add a  little more definition to the right side.
ARCHER: We don't need it to be too perfect.
PHLOX: Of course, Captain.
T'POL : T'Pol to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL : Please report to the Bridge.
ARCHER: Is there a problem?
T'POL: I'm detecting neutrino emissions from a city on the eastern  continent.
ARCHER: What's causing it?
T'POL: Possibly an antimatter reactor.
TUCKER: These people don't even have indoor plumbing.
HOSHI: Maybe some of them are more advanced than others.
ARCHER: Or maybe we're not the first visitors. What about  non-indigenous biosigns?
T'POL: I'm not reading any, but at this range it's hard to be certain.
ARCHER: Trip, T'Pol, let's head down to Sickbay.  Let the  quartermaster know we'll need three more sets of clothing.
TUCKER: My feet would be a lot happier in my own boots.
ARCHER: What's this?
HOSHI: Identification papers. Everyone in the city has to carry them.
TUCKER: T'Pol.
HOSHI: T'Pol.
ARCHER: Over here.
TUCKER: I've got it too. The reactor's about eight metres under this  building.
ARCHER: Looks like some kind of curio shop.
ARCHER: I guess we'll have to wait until morning.
TUCKER: There could be a lot more people around then. It might be  easier to get a look at this thing tonight.
ARCHER: Except we're on the wrong side of this door.
TUCKER: Not for long.
ARCHER: Seventy eight light years to get here, our first act is  breaking and entering.
TUCKER: Maybe you don't have to mention this part in your log?
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Going as fast as I can.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL : Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: I think we found what we're looking for.
T'POL: Acknowledged. We'll meet at your coordinates.
TUCKER: Back here.
TUCKER: The neutrino emissions are off the meter. It's got to be  through here.
TUCKER: It's some kind of magnetic barrier.
ARCHER: Can you disable it?
TUCKER: I'll try.
RIANN: Who are you? What did you do to that door?
TUCKER: Nothing, honest.
RIANN: I want to know what you're doing here.
ARCHER: You don't need to point that weapon at us. We're collectors.  We're picking up an antique.
RIANN: A real collector would've waited until the shop was open. You're  not here to pick up any antiques. I've been watching the shop for  weeks. I know all about your evening deliveries.
ARCHER: Deliveries?
RIANN: People are getting sick. Some are even dying because of what's  going on in here. Did you know that? Move away from the door.
ARCHER: Was that necessary?
T'POL: She was armed.
ARCHER: Let's try not to shoot anyone else while we're here, okay?
T'POL: I'll try.
ARCHER: The reactor signature's coming from the other side of that  door, but it's protected by some kind of energy field.
T'POL: We should go. It'll be dawn soon.
TUCKER: What about her? We can't just leave her here.
ARCHER: Hoshi.
HOSHI: Her name's Riann, she's an apothecary.
ARCHER: I'll meet you back at the shuttle.
RIANN:  What did you do to me?
ARCHER: Nothing. You just collapsed.
RIANN: That's the second lie you've told me. You're not very good at  it. Why did you bring me back here. Did Garos tell you to? Are you  working for him?
ARCHER: Garos?
RIANN: You don't know who I'm talking about. He owns the shop you broke  into.
ARCHER: I'm not working for anyone. I just wanted to make sure you got  home all right.
RIANN: Wait. If you don't work for him, what were you doing in there?
ARCHER: There's something strange going on in that shop. I don't know  what, exactly, but I'm trying to figure it out. I'm an investigator  from another city.
RIANN: Which city? Who sent you?
ARCHER: I can't tell you anymore than that, not right now.
RIANN: I suppose telling me nothing is better than another lie.
ARCHER: My colleague's waiting for me. I've got to go. You said  something about a sickness. I wanted to come back tomorrow and talk to  you about it. Will you be here?
RIANN: You didn't tell me your name.
ARCHER: Jon.
RIANN: Jon. How far away is this city?
REED: Even if we flatten the building with a  torpedo barrage, it probably wouldn't make a dent in that energy field.
ARCHER : What about the shop itself, can you scan underneath it?
REED: That's strange. Sensors aren't
REED : Picking up anything under the shop. No  basement, no bedrock. It's like the building's sitting on nothing at  all.
TUCKER: There must be some kind of dampening field in place.
ARCHER: Keep you sensors locked on that shop. If you notice anything  else out of the ordinary, let me know right away.
REED : Understood.
ARCHER: That woman, Riann, said something about people getting sick.
HOSHI: I think we may have seen some of them. Mottled skin, lesions on  their faces.
TUCKER: If we can get one of these people to the ship, Doctor Phlox  might be able to tell us what's wrong with them.
T'POL: I'd advise against that. If I'm not mistake, the fear of alien  abduction caused a great deal of apprehension on your planet for  centuries. Perhaps we should talk to the shopkeeper first.
GAROS: Welcome, gentlemen. If I don't have what you're looking for, I'm  certain I can find someone who does. Can I help you?
ARCHER: We noticed antiques in the window. My friend here is an amateur  collector.
GAROS: Were you looking for something in particular?
TUCKER: These are interesting.
GAROS: You won't find a more varied collection in the entire city. This  is the pride of my entire collection. 
TUCKER: Who's it supposed to be?
GAROS: Draylan, the mythical ruler of the afterworld.
GAROS: You're not from this province, are you?
ARCHER: No, and neither are you. Your DNA doesn't match any other  lifeform on this planet.
GAROS: Nor does yours. I see why you have  a fondness for masks. Who are you?
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We're  explorers from the planet Earth.
GAROS: Earth? I never heard of it. How did you know I was here?
TUCKER: We picked up the signature from your reactor.
ARCHER: Now that you know who we are, maybe you could tell us what  you're doing here.
GAROS: I'm an explorer as well. At least, I used to be. I'm from the  Malurian system. Two years ago I led a survey mission to study the  Akaali. We had no plans to remain here, but after a few months I found  myself quite taken with these people, so I decided to stay.
ARCHER: If you enjoy the simple life so much, why do you have an  antimatter reactor in your basement?
GAROS: There's nothing nefarious about it, I assure you. The reactor  powers a fabrication device. It allows me to make food and clothing.
ARCHER: I don't know if you've heard, but there's an illness spreading  through this area. Some people seem to think you're the cause of it.
GAROS: I see you've met our apothecary.
ARCHER: You know her?
GAROS: She's been making baseless accusations against me for months.  There's a lethal virus spreading among the Akaali, but it's indigenous.  I certainly didn't bring it here. Unfortunately these people don't have  the medical technology to cure it, so this woman blames the newcomer,  me.
ARCHER: If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to take a look at this reactor  of yours.
GAROS: Perhaps some other time, Captain. Excuse me. Welcome. If I don't  have what you're looking for I'm certain I can find someone who does.  Gentlemen. 
ARCHER: His reactor's got an awful lot of power  for a fabrication device.
TUCKER: He could probably feed and clothe half the continent with it.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL : Go ahead.
ARCHER: How soon can you meet us?
RIANN: Yes.
ARCHER: Hello again.
RIANN: Hello. Who's your friend?
ARCHER: Her name's T'Pol. She's helping me investigate Garos's shop.  You two have something in common. T'Pol is a scientist as well.
T'POL: Your facility's impressive.  Would you mind?
RIANN: If you're careful not to touch anything. You two are from the  same province?
ARCHER: Not exactly.
RIANN: Must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to  yourself.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, I don't mean to be evasive.
RIANN: Yes, you do.
RIANN: Turn down that  flame, please.
ARCHER: I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about this  illness.
RIANN: Why don't you tell me why you were in Garos's shop.
ARCHER: We were trying to get into the basement. We think there's some  kind of machine there, something he's not supposed to have.
RIANN: What kind of machine?
ARCHER: We're not sure, but it may be indirectly connected to this  epidemic. If you can tell us what you know, we might be able to help.
RIANN: I can't tell you much. People are dying and I can't determine  why. Drop this in the water, carefully. I learned of the epidemic about  eighteen months ago. My brother was one of the first victims.
ARCHER: I'm sorry.
RIANN: At first I thought it was some kind of airborne contagion, but  it never spread beyond this part of the city. I'm sampled the soil, the  water, I can't find anything out of the ordinary. 
ARCHER: Why do you believe this Garos is involved?
RIANN: The first cases occurred here
RIANN: A few  hundred metres from his shop. That was just one month after he arrived.
ARCHER: You said something about evening deliveries.
RIANN: Every few nights, someone carries crates from his shop to  different places outside the city. When I've gone back in the morning,  crates are gone. Hand me that.
ARCHER: That's why you were watching his shop. You thought we were  there for the crates.
RIANN: Tea. Would you like some?
T'POL: Jon, may I speak with you?
ARCHER: I'd love a cup.
ARCHER: Did you  get what you need?
T'POL: I should return to the ship and begin my analysis.
ARCHER: All right, you and the others head back.
T'POL: What about you?
ARCHER: I'll stay here, see if I can earn more about Garos and these  shipments.
T'POL: The longer you remain, the more you risk cultural contamination.
ARCHER: These people are suffering from something a lot worse than  cultural contamination. We've got to find out what it is.
T'POL: Enjoy your tea.
PHLOX: Quite impressive. Did you say this is a pre-industrial society?
T'POL: Yes.
PHLOX: Her methods may be unrefined, but this woman is using forensic  techniques far more sophisticated than I would've expected. Isn't it  extraordinary? Thousands of sentient species in our little corner of  the cosmos, each one discovering science in their own unique way.
PHLOX: Had this woman been born on  Vulcan or Earth I'm sure she would have made a fine physician. Here's  our culprit. The water sample's contaminated with tetracyanate 622.
T'POL: I'm not familiar with it.
PHLOX: It's a synthetic compound primarily used as an industrial  lubricant, usually under the strictest safety protocols. It's quite  toxic.
T'POL: Could this be responsible for the epidemic?
PHLOX: If it's managed to seep into the ground water, absolutely.
T'POL: I'll notify the Captain.
RIANN: Samples from three  new subjects indicate no
ARCHER: Did you say something?
RIANN: Sorry. I mutter when I'm writing sometimes. It's an old habit.
ARCHER: I have a similar one. I talk to my dog.
RIANN: My mother bought me a tousorobco once, but it tuployo pludak.
ARCHER: What was that?
ARCHER: Are you all right?
RIANN: All right? I'm all right.
ARCHER: Someone was walking this way, but he turned and went around the  corner. I thought if we pretended to be
RIANN: I understand.
ARCHER: I want you to head back.
RIANN: Not before I see what's in those crates. Help me open this.
ARCHER: Move!
RIANN: Have you ever seen anything like that?
ARCHER: Actually, I have.
ARCHER: Stay here.
RIANN: Jon!
ARCHER: It's all right. He's not dead.
RIANN: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me, Jon?
RIANN: If your ship can travel to so many stars  then why would you come here?
ARCHER: To meet you.
RIANN: Me?
ARCHER: Not you personally, but your people.
RIANN: Why? We're so backward compared to you.
ARCHER: If you take away our technology we're not that different.
ARCHER: Come on.
ARCHER : They're mining some kind of veridium  isotope.
T'POL: Veridium is primarily used to manufacture explosives.
ARCHER : I'm not surprised.
T'POL: Did you find any traces of tetracyanate?
ARCHER: Their drill bits are saturated with it.  We've got to shut this all down. The reactor seems to be powering the  entire operation but I can't use my phase-pistol. I'd risk blowing up  half the city.
TUCKER: Captain, let me come down there and take a  crack at it.
ARCHER: I doubt that we have that much time. Our  best shot is the transporter. I'll see what I can do about disengaging  that dampening field. Give me a few minutes.
T'POL : Understood.
ARCHER: I don't suppose you read Malurian.
RIANN: Can't you use your device?
ARCHER: It wasn't designed for that.
RIANN: What are we looking for?
ARCHER: There's an energy field surrounding the shop. It's keeping my  ship from seeing what's in here. One of these controls should turn it  off.
RIANN: Here. This is Tengala Street. Here's  the shop. This outline could have something to do with the energy  field. Wait, what are you doing?
ARCHER: If the blue line represents the dampening field, this blue  button should control it.
RIANN: What about the yellow dots?
ARCHER: What about them?
RIANN: How do we know they don't represent the field? Maybe it's the  yellow button.
ARCHER: The blue one's lit.
RIANN: That's what worries me.
ARCHER: We could debate this all day. Blue or yellow?
RIANN: Blue.
TRAVIS: There's a ship approaching.
T'POL: From where?
TRAVIS: It must have been in a geosynchonous orbit on the other side of  the planet.
REED: I'm picking up multiple weapon platforms. They're armed to the  teeth.
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface.
T'POL: The Captain?
HOSHI: I don't think so.
T'POL: On screen.
GAROS : I suggest you leave this system at once or my  ship will open fire.
T'POL: I want to speak with Captain Archer.
GAROS : That won't be possible. He's dead.
REED: The ship's firing.
GAROS : My vessel is capable of firing ten of those  charges simultaneously. Again, I suggest you break orbit.
GAROS: How did you learn about  this facility, Captain? Was it from a somewhat ugly Tellarite merchant  perhaps?
ARCHER: I told you. We detected your reactor from orbit.
GAROS: I forgot. You're explorers.
ARCHER: We're trying to help these people. What you're doing here is  contaminating their water supply.
GAROS: There are five hundred million Akaali on this planet. A few  thousand won't be missed. I'm willing to let you go, provided you  promise not to return. We've instructed your ship to send down a launch  vehicle to take you and the woman.
ARCHER: She belongs here.
GAROS: Believe me, she'll be better off on your ship. Now step away  from the control panel, Captain.
ARCHER: If anyone walks through  either of these doors, aim this and pull the trigger.
REED: They're recharging weapons.
T'POL: Prepare to leave orbit on my order.
TUCKER: Belay that! Keep this ship right where it is.
T'POL: I don't have to reiterate that I outrank you, Mister Tucker.  Ensign.
CREWMAN : Engineering.
TUCKER: Billy, stand by to vent the nacelles on my order.
CREWMAN : Yes, sir.
TUCKER: We're not going anywhere.
T'POL: I didn't say leave orbit, I said prepare to leave orbit. I have  no intention of abandoning the Captain, dead or alive.
HOSHI: The dampening field's down.
TUCKER: Anything?
REED: I've got a fix on it.
TUCKER: Transfer the coordinates.
REED: The forward hull plating's depolarising.
T'POL: Evasive manoeuvres. Keep us within transporter range.
TRAVIS: I'll try.
T'POL: Return fire.
REED: They've got some kind of energy shielding. Our weapons are  ineffective.
HOSHI: It's the Captain.
T'POL: Put him through.
ARCHER: How's it going up there?
T'POL: A Malurian vessel's opened fire. We're  taking damage.
ARCHER: And the reactor?
T'POL: We're trying to get a lock on it now.
T'POL: Are you all right? He said you'd been  killed.
ARCHER: Don't worry about me, just get the  reactor.
RIANN: Jon.
TRAVIS: We've lost lateral thrusters.
T'POL: Commander Tucker, status.
TUCKER: This'd be a lot easier if you'd stop  rocking the boat.
T'POL : How long?
TUCKER: I've almost got a lock.
TRAVIS: I can't shake them.
HOSHI: Even if we get the reactor, how are we going to keep them from  taking it back?
T'POL: If they want it so badly, maybe we should give it to them.
TUCKER: I've got a lock.
REED: (Starboard tube's loaded.
T'POL: Stand by to go to full impulse. Now, Commander.
T'POL: Fire.
REED: Their shielding is down.
T'POL: Come about, Ensign. Target their weapons array.
RIANN: The oil lamp.
ARCHER: What about it?
RIANN: There should be at least a litre of residic oil in the container  below it. Residic oil ignites at three hundred and ninety eight  degrees. You wouldn't happen to have anything that gets that hot?
ARCHER: Archer.
T'POL : The reactor's been destroyed, Captain. We've disarmed the  Malurian ship. Should we disable their engines?
ARCHER: No. They're about to leave, but first they need to pick up  three passengers. Archer out. I don't think you're going to have time  to pack up your shop.
ARCHER: Tell them  to take the entire dose.
RIANN: Just one?
ARCHER: That's all they'll need.
RIANN: What if Garos comes back?
ARCHER: I've notified T'Pol's people. They're going to look in on you  from time to time.
RIANN: They could stop by for tea.
ARCHER: You bet. It's probably best if you keep all this to yourself.
RIANN: Who'd believe me anyway?  Where is your starship headed now?
ARCHER: There are lots of inhabited planets to see, but I doubt many  will be this memorable.
RIANN: Is your translator broken again?
ARCHER: I'm sorry? I don't understand a word you're saying.
