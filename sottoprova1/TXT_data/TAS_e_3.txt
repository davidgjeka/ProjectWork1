SPOCK: If my calculations are correct, Captain, we  have twenty seconds to go.
KIRK: Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura,  place the ship on Yellow Alert.
UHURA: Aye, sir. Yellow Alert.
SPOCK: Five seconds. Four, three
UHURA: All stations report Yellow Alert status, sir. Captain, I'm  getting some sort of subspace radio signal.
KIRK: Put it on ship's speaker.
UHURA: It's more like music than a message.
SPOCK: Captain, we are being probed.
KIRK: From where? Can you trace it?
SPOCK: The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away.
KIRK: Can you identify it?
SPOCK: It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of  this sector.
KIRK: That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a  distance.
SCOTT: It seems to be calling us.
KIRK: Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself.
SPOCK: It does resemble a summons.
UHURA: I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain.
KIRK: Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant  Arex. Warp factor seven.
CHAPEL: You wanted me, Lieutenant? Are you all right?
UHURA: I am. But I want you to observe the men here. It seemed to start  when we picked up that signal, and it's gotten worse.
SPOCK: Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing  audio-visual suggestion, Captain.
KIRK: So am I.
KIRK: Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock?
SPOCK: Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe.
UHURA: Sir, what visions? We don't see anything.
KIRK: Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either?
CHAPEL: No, sir.
KIRK: Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor  McCoy to the Bridge.
UHURA: Sickbay, Doctor McCoy. Please report to the Bridge. Doctor  McCoy? No response.
MCCOY: Magnolias in blossom. Beautiful.
UHURA: The signal's getting stronger, sir.
KIRK: Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are  affected, Captain. I suggest
SCOTT: Ship's log, stardate 5483.8. Engineering Officer Scott in  command. We are in orbit around planet two in the Taurean system.  Probes and sensors indicate there was once a vast civilisation here.  Lovely. Lovely. However, life readings are sparse and concentrated.  Captain Kirk is beaming down with a scouting party to investigate.
UHURA: These figures just don't match up with Spock's. So far I count  three sensor readings that are off.
KIRK: Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could  have built it.
CARVER: You want all those routine readings, sir.
KIRK: No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it.
MCCOY: There is something compelling about it.
KIRK: Yes, I feel it too, Bones.
SPOCK: Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion.  I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of  its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre.
KIRK: There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go.
THEELA: They are here.
ALL: Oh, such wondrous ones. They honour us.
THEELA: I am Theela, the Head Female. Welcome, James Kirk, Doctor  McCoy, Mister Spock. Welcome.
SPOCK: The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences.  Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level.
MCCOY: First time I ever admired a body function.
KIRK: How do you know our names?
THEELA: The Opto-aud revealed you to us.
SPOCK: Tonal control. Fascinating.
THEELA: The Opto-aud will reveal whatever is asked, Mister Spock. We  are grateful that you heard the signal, Captain.
KIRK: The signal? A distress call, wasn't it?
THEELA: I will explain its meaning later. We have prepared a feast to  celebrate your presence.
MCCOY: These are the most beautiful women in the galaxy. But where are  the men?
THEELA: They occupy another compound.
KIRK: That makes sense.
WOMAN: Mister Spock.
KIRK: Spock
THEELA: Take them to the slumber chambers. They must rest.
MCCOY: Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy.
MCCOY: Jim, Jim!
CHAPEL: Results of every scan run by the women  science teams. If there is an answer, it's here.
COMPUTER: Computer on.
CHAPEL: Summation of medical, biological, astrophysical scans.
COMPUTER: Working. Probe directed at ship from planet surface is  severely enervating to humanoid males. Exposure causes increasing  weakness. Possibly to point of death.
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison.
DAVISON : Davison here.
UHURA: I want an all-woman security team on every transporter  immediately. No one is to transport down to the planet unless it is on  my order.
DAVISON : Aye, aye, Lieutenant.
CHAPEL: What are you doing?
UHURA: Taking command of this ship.
SPOCK: We must return to our duties aboard ship.
KIRK: Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have
THEELA: You cannot leave, Mister Spock. You are needed here. Soon, all  the men on your ship will feel as you do. They are all needed, and they  will join us.
KIRK: We must go.
THEELA: Obstruct them.
SCOTT:  I dream of ... the gala lads ...  can I trow 
UHURA: Mister Scott, as senior Lieutenant, I'm taking responsibility  for the safety of this ship.
SCOTT: Very thoughtful of you, love.
UHURA: Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant Uhura recording. Due to  Chief Engineering Officer Scott's euphoric state of mind, I am assuming  command of the Enterprise, I accept full responsibility for my action.  A detailed account will be recorded later. Nurse Chapel, until further  notice, you will act as Chief Medical Officer.
CHAPEL: Yes, Lieutenant.
KIRK: They've gone.
SPOCK: Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will  help us.
MCCOY: I wonder why they let me keep it.
SPOCK: Perhaps they saw no practical use in it.
MCCOY: Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant.
KIRK: Go ahead.
KIRK: Locked.
SPOCK:  If the lock is magnetised, this may  disrupt its field.
THEELA: Assistance! Assistance!
KIRK: The urn. It's the only place.
THEELA: This way.
WOMAN: They are not here, Theela.
THEELA : Come. They might have returned to  where they landed.
KIRK: The headbands. Look at them.
SPOCK: I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not  present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital  energy to the bodies of the women.
KIRK: You mean they're actually draining our life forces?
SPOCK: That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our  weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our  strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital.
KIRK: How long do we have, Spock?
SPOCK: We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain.
MCCOY: Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead!
KIRK: And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would  join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact  the ship.
SPOCK: I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal  structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I  go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the  ship.
SPOCK: The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is  it?
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise.
UHURA : Enterprise.
SPOCK: Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All
THEELA: Greetings. I am Theela. Head Female of this compound.
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura of the Starship Enterprise. We're here to  locate Captain Kirk.
THEELA: Return to your ship. You are not wanted here.
UHURA: Until we find Captain Kirk, we will not leave.
UHURA: Phasers on stun. Fire!
UHURA: Search the temple. Parties of two.
UHURA: No sign of them anywhere.
SPOCK : Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel.
CHAPEL: Wait.
UHURA: What is it?
CHAPEL: I heard Spock's voice.
SPOCK : Christine.
CHAPEL: It is Spock. There must be a panel somewhere.
CHAPEL: Mister Spock!
UHURA: Spock, what happened?
KIRK: We've got to get out of here.
CHAPEL: Spock, Oh, Spock.
SPOCK: Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector  shields. Block probe.
CHAPEL: We tried that.
SPOCK: Use all ship's energy. Everything channelled to the shields.  Hurry, Christine.
UHURA: Release Captain Kirk and his men or we will destroy your temple.
THEELA: Wait! I will tell you everything.
THEELA: The past. Reveal it.
THEELA: This is the race from whom we are descended. They came to this  planet when our homeworld began to die. They built this place and all  surrounding it. They did not know this planet drains humanoid energy.  But the women's bodies developed a glandular secretion, enabling them  to survive and to manipulate certain areas of the males' brains,  influence their emotional senses. Ultimately, it drained the men,  caused them to weaken and die.
THEELA: To survive, we must vitalise each twenty seven years of your  time.
WOMAN: Instead, we are eternal prisoners. We neither age nor die. We  are unable even to bear children.
UHURA: What about Captain Kirk and the others? Can the Opto-aud locate  them?
THEELA: We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them.
UHURA: They're drowning! Where are they?
THEELA: The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here.
UHURA: That looks like a pool or a tub.
THEELA: It is the urn in the garden.
UHURA: Phasers on setting one. Fire.
CHAPEL: No results, Captain. We've tried everything we know.
SPOCK: Perhaps the transporter is the key.
MCCOY: Key to what?
SPOCK: Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original  bodies when we beamed down to the planet.
KIRK: Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we  were?
SPOCK: Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to  one.
SPOCK: We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter  as previously directed.
CHAPEL: But this has never been done before.  Suppose it fails?
SCOTT: Their patterns'll break up, scatter in space. Transporter  reprogrammed, Mister Spock.
KIRK : Beam us up, Scotty.
UHURA: Scotty, we're losing them!
KIRK: Did it work?
UHURA: You're more handsome than ever.
THEELA: Tell Captain Kirk we have kept the agreement.
UHURA: A crew of women will bring a ship back. You'll be transported to  the first suitable planet.
THEELA: How quickly will we become as other women?
UHURA: Doctor McCoy says it should only take a few months.
THEELA: A life of hope. New learning. Perhaps love. Oh, it is a much  better future than immortality.
