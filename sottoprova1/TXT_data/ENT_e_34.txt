HOSHI: These are at least three hundred years older than the ones in  the last chamber.
TUCKER: You sure you can't read any of this?
HOSHI: No. How about you?
TUCKER: Well, I think this says tall guys are popular.
HOSHI: You're a budding linguist. Let's get a shot of that one.
HOSHI: I wonder what happened to them.
TUCKER: It is kind of weird. Not a single biosign on the entire planet.   Tucker.
ARCHER : You about finished down there, Trip?
TUCKER: You can't believe these ruins, sir. We've been through two  dozen chambers. No telling
TUCKER : How many more there are.
ARCHER: I'm afraid you're not going to find out today. That storm we  told you about hasn't changed course.
ARCHER : You and Hoshi are going to need to  get back to Enterprise.
TUCKER: We'll just finish up with Mister Tall and Popular. We should  back to the shuttlepod in five, six minutes.
ARCHER: Don't take any longer than that. Archer  out.
T'POL: Captain? We have another storm.
ARCHER: Another one?
T'POL: The discharges are more intense.
ARCHER: It's a good deal bigger.
T'POL: And stronger. It's pushing the first storm through these  mountains at twice the speed it was moving a few minutes ago.
REED: They're diamagnetic storms, Captain, saturated with polaric  energy.
ARCHER: This is the shuttle?
T'POL: Less than ten kilometres from the first storm.
ARCHER : You may not be able to see yet, but it'll be coming  through the mountain pass to the north.
TUCKER: We can see it just fine, Captain.
ARCHER: The storms are throwing up too much  interference into the atmosphere. The shuttle's out of the question.
HOSHI: Captain, these ruins have very thick walls.  I'm sure we'll be safe inside.
ARCHER: I'm afraid we're not talking about  thunderclouds, Hoshi. A polaric burst that could short-circuit a  shuttlepod could do a lot worse to your nervous system.
HOSHI : But sir, these buildings are
HOSHI: Over four thousand years old. I'm sure  they've survived hundreds of these storms.
ARCHER: I've sent Malcolm down to the transporter.  We're going to need to bring you up
ARCHER : One at a time.
HOSHI: Couldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? Polarise the hull  plating.
T'POL: That would most likely attract the polaric  discharge.
ARCHER: You have to do this, Hoshi.
ARCHER : There's no choice. I'll need you  clear of the structure
ARCHER: One at a time.
TUCKER: Understood, Captain. Ladies first.
HOSHI: Have you ever done this?
TUCKER: No, but the Captain has, and Malcolm did it twice. They said  there's nothing to it.
HOSHI: Your molecules get pulled apart.
TUCKER: Then they get put back together again.
HOSHI: Do you know how many molecules you're made up of?
TUCKER: Lots.
HOSHI: All right, how many?
TUCKER: A few trillion.
HOSHI: That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. What if some other pieces get  put in the wrong place? You know, I bet a lot of them look real  similar.
TUCKER: Starfleet said it's safe. That's good enough for me.
HOSHI: Okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to Enterprise in one  piece I'll be right behind you.
TUCKER: Fair enough. Tucker to Enterprise.
REED : I read you, Commander.
TUCKER: Ready to go.
HOSHI:  Commander?
TUCKER : Safe and sound.
HOSHI: I'm on my way, sir.
HOSHI: Ensign Sato ready for transport.
REED: Welcome to the club.
TUCKER: How do those molecules feel? All in the right place?
HOSHI: I'll let you know.
HOSHI: Come in.
ARCHER: No worse for the wear, Ensign?
HOSHI: I guess you could say that, sir. I'll be at my post in a few  minutes. I just want to clean up and change.
ARCHER: I think you've had enough excitement for one afternoon. The  morning'll be fine.
HOSHI: Thank you.
ARCHER: I assume you and Trip will want to finish your survey tomorrow,  weather permitting.
HOSHI: Sir?
ARCHER: You left a shuttlepod down there, remember? Somebody's got to  go back and get it.
HOSHI: I'm sure Commander Tucker can find someone else to hold the  second flash unit.
ARCHER: You wouldn't be using the transporter, Hoshi. You'd be taking  the other pod.
HOSHI: I don't want to get lost.
ARCHER: Lost?
HOSHI: Too much excitement for one day. I could really use some rest,  sir.
ARCHER: See you in the morning.
REED: So he tells her it was merely a warp  imbalance.
TUCKER: That's a lie, Malcolm.
REED: We all heard it, Commander. There's no use pretending.
TUCKER: Come on, Travis.
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here?
TUCKER: Don't you think a Vulcan would see right through this one?
TRAVIS: But that's what you said, though.
HOSHI: Is anyone sitting here?
TUCKER: No, please. 
TRAVIS: So, what was it like?
REED: Travis, let her eat her supper.
HOSHI: It was very unsettling. Didn't you find it unsettling?
TUCKER: For a minute or two, but once I counted my fingers and toes.
HOSHI: I don't know. I just don't feel right.
TUCKER: It was probably that storm. You don't forget things like that  too quickly.
HOSHI: Not the storms, it's the transporter. I don't feel like myself  since I went through it. I need to check the medical database and find  out what happened to people they used when they were testing that  thing.
REED: You mean other than Cyrus Ramsey?
HOSHI: Cyrus Ramsey?
TUCKER: Don't tell me you don't know about poor Cyrus.
HOSHI: Am I supposed to?
TRAVIS: You can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story  about someone seeing Ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy  night.
HOSHI: What happened to him?
TUCKER: Next thing you'll tell us you never heard of the Easter bunny.
HOSHI: What happened to him?
TUCKER: Madison, Wisconsin, May, I think, 2146. He was a test subject  for the first long-range transport. Just one hundred metres. Something  went wrong with the pattern buffer. He never rematerialised.
REED: Come on, Hoshi, everybody's heard of Cyrus Ramsey.
HOSHI: I must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories.
TUCKER: Where'd you do your survival training?
TRAVIS: Death Valley, California. Middle of July, naturally. You?
TUCKER: Captain and I were in the same group. Alice Springs, Australia.  Never saw so many flies in my life. Biting kind.   Tucker.
ARCHER : The storms are breaking up. I don't think we'll have any  trouble getting you back down in the morning.
TUCKER: Travis was just telling me he'd like to see the ruins.
ARCHER : Well, I don't think Hoshi will be joining you.
TUCKER: I'll need a pilot to bring the other pod back.
ARCHER : Travis it is. I'll see you both in the morning. Archer  out.
TUCKER: Never say I don't take you anywhere.
TRAVIS: You don't take me anywhere.
HOSHI: See you later.
HOSHI: Doctor? Doctor Phlox.  Hello?
PHLOX: Ensign. Something I can do for you?
HOSHI: I just looked in there. Were you in there? Did you hear me come  in?
PHLOX: I was feeding my leeches. Are you all right?
HOSHI: You didn't hear me?
PHLOX: I'm right here, Ensign. Are you not feeling well?
HOSHI: No, I'm not feeling well. I dematerialised, and then I  rematerialised and, no, I'm not feeling well.
PHLOX: I heard about your ordeal on the surface. Those storms sounded  terrifying.
HOSHI: Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms. I'm talking about my  molecules.
PHLOX: Come sit down. Let's take a look.
PHLOX: It'll  take me a while to account for every molecule, but you appear to be in  one piece. I don't think you're in danger of becoming the next Cyrus  Ramsey.
HOSHI: Don't tell me they talk about him on Denobula.
PHLOX: I spent nearly nine months on Earth, remember?
HOSHI: I just don't feel right. Ever since the transport, I've been  shaky, not myself.
PHLOX: Not a single bio-molecular anomaly.
HOSHI: No? How about this?
PHLOX: A subcutaneous pigmentation.
HOSHI: It's not where it used to be. It was a good centimetre lower.
PHLOX: Well, it looks lovely where it is now.
HOSHI: It's not a joke, Doctor. If that machine could move a birthmark,  who knows what else it could do. I'm telling you, I don't feel right.
PHLOX: I have a lot of animals to feed before bedtime. If I were you,  I'd get a good night's sleep, hmm?
HOSHI: Hello?
T'POL : You're needed on the Bridge, Ensign.
HOSHI: What time is it?
T'POL : Eleven hundred hours. There's been an emergency.
HOSHI: Eleven hundred hours, that's impossible. My shift starts at oh  eight hundred.
T'POL : Now, Ensign.
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Captain, I don't know what  happened.
ARCHER: Tucker and Mayweather have been taken hostage. Trip got a short  message but we haven't heard anything in the last hour.
HOSHI: Taken hostage by who?
ARCHER: The people down there didn't like you disturbing their ruins.
HOSHI: People? There wasn't a biosign on the planet.
T'POL: The chambers you and Mister Tucker photographed contained sacred  relics.
HOSHI: How could you possibly know that?
ARCHER: Have you found their biosigns?
REED: They're still in the complex. I'm trying to isolate the specific  chamber.
HOSHI:  It's Mayweather's communicator.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Travis.
ALIEN : 
ARCHER: Ensign?
HOSHI: I need more.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We apologise  if we've trespassed. My crewmen didn't mean any harm.
ALIEN : 
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir, it's not working. I'm going to need more.
ARCHER: Can I speak to one of my officers?
ALIEN : 
ARCHER: It's not going to get much better than that.
T'POL: What's the problem?
REED: Maybe you should forget about the UT. Just try and talk to them.
HOSHI: Ajas sukas.
ALIEN : 
HOSHI: Tag zra uras turana.
ALIEN : 
HOSHI: If I went back to the universal translator, maybe I could
ARCHER: You already tried that. Talk to them.
HOSHI: I can't.
T'POL: Lives are at stake, Ensign.
HOSHI: I know. I don't understand what he's saying. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm  sorry.
ARCHER: No need to apologise. Why don't you go back to your quarters  and get some rest.
HOSHI: Captain, I realise I overslept. I don't know how it happened,  but please, I don't want to go back to my quarters.
ARCHER:  Take the comm.
BAIRD: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here? Sub-commander?
T'POL: Ensign. Would you like to  join me?
HOSHI: Thank you. I would've thought you'd be on the Bridge.
T'POL: Why is that?
HOSHI: Commander Tucker. Travis.
T'POL: The hostage situation was resolved. They're back on board.
HOSHI: It's only been an hour since I left the Bridge. What happened?
T'POL: Crewman Baird deciphered their language. A simple bimodal  syntax.
HOSHI: I don't understand. How?
T'POL: With the universal translator.
HOSHI: That's impossible. I ran every linguistic algorithm.
T'POL: When the Captain agreed to return the soil and rock samples, and  destroy the photographs that were taken, the hostages were released.
HOSHI: If we've decrypted their language, I should get back to the  Bridge. It sounds like the Captain might want to speak with them again.
T'POL: Captain Archer has asked that you remain off duty for the time  being. Crewman Baird has been placed in charge of communications.
ALISON:  After lunch, you should take  a look at the secondary couplings. They're going to need to be aligned.
HOSHI: Alison.
ALISON: Start on C deck, then work your way down.
CREWMAN: Yes ma'am.
REED : The stream's too unstable.
TUCKER : Come on, Hoshi.
HOSHI: What?
REED : You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two,
HOSHI: Can you see me?
PHLOX: Ensign?
HOSHI: Can you see me?
PHLOX: Is there something in particular you'd like me to look at?
HOSHI: Something's wrong, Doctor. Something's very wrong. Ever since I  used that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed to  be. I couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but Crewman Baird  could. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic  database. And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my  mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't  decide whether to bounce off me or go through me. Nobody wants to talk  to me. Sometimes I think they don't even see that I'm there. The  turbolift control won't even respond to me.
PHLOX: Well, I see you, Ensign, and the Sickbay doors responded when  you came in. Transporter technology is very new.  I'm sure  humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, or  the airplane. New forms of transport take a while to get used to. I'm  not at all surprised at your reaction. You wouldn't catch me using that  apparatus. But I can promise you one thing. You're in perfect health.  You're neither transparent nor porous.
HOSHI: You won't put this on my medical record, will you?
PHLOX: As far as I'm concerned I didn't even see you come in here.
HOSHI: Not funny, Doctor.
PHLOX: I would like to give you a mild sedative. It'll help you get a  good night's sleep.
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you the last thing I need right now is  to be medicated.
PHLOX: As you wish, but stop by in the morning, all right?
HOSHI: First thing. Thank you, Doctor.
TUCKER: You're upside down, Ensign.
HOSHI: I was taught never to contradict a superior officer. The Captain  told me what happened. Did they treat you all right?
TUCKER: Didn't even tie us up. As soon as the Captain promised to give  them their stuff back they walked us to the shuttlepods and away we  went.
HOSHI: I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful trying to translate. I don't  know what happened.
TUCKER: Well, we're safe and sound. That's all that matters. Have you  tried this thing?
HOSHI: I get motion sickness, remember? Have you felt okay since we  were transported yesterday?
TUCKER: Considering that I've been back down to the surface, kidnapped  and released, I've probably had better days. Why, are you not feeling  well?
HOSHI: I  didn't think I was, but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms are  psychological.
TUCKER: What kind of symptoms?
HOSHI: I just haven't been myself. Everything's a little off ,even the  laws of physics.
TUCKER: Well, in that case, you're right. You shouldn't get on this  thing. The laws of physics don't apply in here, either. Sorry. Just  trying to cheer you up.
HOSHI: It's okay. Phlox promises me I'll be fine.
TUCKER: It's going to be a while before  any of us gets used to being taken apart and put back together again.  It seems perfectly natural to be anxious about it.
HOSHI: I hope it's just a question of being  anxious.
TUCKER: What else could it be?
HOSHI: I saw my reflection become transparent. I saw water pass right  through my hand. I'm not convinced that the transporter put me back the  way it was supposed to.
TUCKER: All the king's horses and all the king's men. I can see why you  might imagine the universe unraveling. If you're afraid you haven't  been put back together right, why assume anything else makes sense? If  I were you, I'd ask the Doc for a sedative. Nothing like crawling into  bed.
HOSHI: You men are all alike.
TUCKER: Wait and see. A night's sleep will do you a world of good.
HOSHI: Thank God you're here. I've been stuck in here for hours. The  door control is
TUCKER: She was here last night, right over there.
HOSHI: Commander.
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
T'POL: Have the security details reported back?
ARCHER : No sign of her yet.
T'POL: We've covered the forward section of C deck. She's not here.
HOSHI: Yes, she is.
TUCKER: Have you tried the biosensors again, Captain?
ARCHER : Still nothing.
TUCKER: I'll go take a look at them.
ARCHER : I'm going to maintain our present orbit until Hoshi turns  up. T'Pol, meet me in Sickbay right away.
T'POL: Yes, sir.
PHLOX: She came to Sickbay after the incident with  the storm, then a second time early last night.
ARCHER: She wasn't feeling well?
PHLOX: She said she felt shaky. You're aware that was the first time  she'd ever transported?
T'POL: Quite aware.
PHLOX: I believed that was the source of her anxiety. She was convinced  her molecules hadn't been reassembled properly. I should've taken her  more seriously. These are the biomolecular scans I took during each of  her two visits.
PHLOX: They  seemed perfectly normal at the time. When I heard she was missing  something made me take a closer look. You see these protein filaments?  Now look at this.
ARCHER: I'm going to need some help here, Phlox.
PHLOX: Look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded. These  scans were taken less than twenty four hours apart. It's virtually  impossible.
ARCHER: What's impossible?
T'POL: Ensign Sato wasn't imagining it. Her molecules are coming apart.
TUCKER: It's the  secondary phase coils.
ARCHER: What about them?
TUCKER: They're not aligning. They're not perfectly synchronised.  Must've happened right after it came up from the surface.
PHLOX: If they're not perfectly synchronised?
T'POL: The resequencing would start to dissipate. Within hours, she'll  lose molecular cohesion.
TUCKER: She didn't want to go first. I told her I wouldn't leave her  alone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second. She  wanted to be sure it was working, that it was safe. I'm the one who  should be missing. I told her to go first. She should've listened to  me.
HOSHI: It wasn't your fault.
ARCHER: Take the transporter offline and figure out what went wrong.  Starfleet promised me this sort of thing wouldn't happen.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
PHLOX: Captain, if there was a loss of molecular cohesion I'm afraid we  shouldn't be looking for Hoshi, per se.
ARCHER: What should we be looking for?
PHLOX: Subcellular residue. There wouldn't be anything left by now  except for subcellular residue.
HOSHI: You're wrong, Doctor. I'm still in one piece. You just can't see  me.
ARCHER:  Have the Doctor help you recalibrate the sensors.  Then start scanning for this residue. Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS : Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER: Prepare to break orbit and resume previous course.
TRAVIS: : Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: I'll be in, my ready room.
PHLOX: There's no way to be  certain this is her.
TUCKER: Is it Hoshi's DNA or isn't it?
PHLOX: It's difficult to tell. The amino acids have broken down.
HOSHI: Don't waste your time. It's not me.
TUCKER: The internal scan said access shaft B7. She's got to be here  somewhere.
HOSHI: If you spent a little more time trying to figure out what  happened to
ALIEN : 
TUCKER : What's the problem?
REED : The stream's too unstable.
HOSHI: Lieutenant?
REED : You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two
TUCKER: Here, Doc, over here. What do you think?
PHLOX: Try isolating the dipeptides. Now run a comparison with her  genetic profile.
TUCKER: Why would she have come down here?
PHLOX: I doubt we'll ever know, Commander. Captain Archer will want  Hoshi's parents to have this.
PHLOX: They're both alive, aren't they?
TUCKER: Yeah, both alive. You go ahead, Doc. I'm going to stick around  for a minute.
PHLOX: I understand.
TUCKER: Hoshi.
HOSHI: You can see me?
TUCKER: I should've made you go first. What could I have been thinking  leaving you down there? I was the ranking officer, and I had no  business leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms. Why didn't  you listen to me? I told you we'd be safe. And now look what you've  done.
ALIEN : 
HOSHI: Captain, I need you to listen to me. There are aliens on board  from the surface. They're planting bombs on D deck. You've got to hear  me. The ship is in danger.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
BAIRD : We've located her father, sir. The mother isn't home.
ARCHER: What time is it there?
BAIRD : Oh nine hundred.
ARCHER: Put him through.
ARCHER: Good  morning, sir.
SATO : Captain Archer. Is everything all right?
ARCHER: No sir, everything is not all right. We've had an accident with  our transporting device.
SATO : Transporting device? What is that?
HOSHI: You don't have time for this.
ARCHER: A matter stream converter. It was approved for transporting  bio-matter before we left Earth.
HOSHI: I'll find something that'll get your attention.
ARCHER: We've used it a number of times to
SATO : Bio-matter? What are you referring to, produce or  people?
ARCHER: I'm just trying to explain to you that Star Fleet told us it  was safe.
SATO : So, Hoshi is safe.
ARCHER: No, sir. There was an accident. She began to, her molecules  began to destabilise.
SATO : Her molecules? What are you talking about, Captain?
ARCHER: This isn't easy, sir. I fought to get Hoshi to come on this  mission. I'm responsible for her being out here. She's, become a member  of our family.
SATO : Family? We're her family, not you. Why are you  calling me? To say that she has become a member of your family? I'm  sorry, Captain. You are not making any sense.
ARCHER: We lost Hoshi today, Mister Sato. I wish I didn't have to tell  you that.
SATO : You are saying Hoshi is dead?
HOSHI: We're all going to be dead if I don't get him to notice this.
SATO : Maybe, you could call us back later. This afternoon?
HOSHI: How about Morse code? You know Morse Code, don't you?
SATO : I must have time to speak to Hoshi's mother.
HOSHI: Come on, listen.
ARCHER: This afternoon.
HOSHI: Can you hear it?
ARCHER: I'm so sorry.
SATO : So am I.
HOSHI: Come on.
HOSIHI: That's  right. It's not supposed to be making that noise, is it? Listen, you  can hear it. SOS. SOS. It's a call for help. I need you to hear it.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL : Yes, Captain?
ARCHER: Could you come in here for a minute?
T'POL : Right away.
HOSHI: That's right, show it to her. One of you will figure it out.
ARCHER: Look at this. I've never heard it make that noise before.
T'POL: The plasma circuit's being interrupted. I'll ask Commander  Tucker to take a look at it.
ARCHER: Listen to the pattern. Three dots, three dashes, three dots.  SOS.
T'POL: Dots?
ARCHER: Dots and dashes. Morse code. Its been used on Earth for  centuries. It's a distress call.
HOSHI: Let's see how good your memory is. H, O,
T'POL: It's changed.
HOSHI: S, H,
ARCHER: It still sounds like Morse code.
HOSHI: I. Come on.
T'POL: This plasma circuit is self-contained. No one outside of this  room could be using it to send a message.
HOSHI: I'm not outside this room, I'm right here.
T'POL: It's been a very difficult day. Perhaps you should try to get  some rest.
ARCHER: You're right. I'll have Trip look at it tomorrow.
HOSHI: Tomorrow's too late. They're going to blow up the ship. Captain!
HOSHI: No, wait!
TUCKER : What's the problem?
HOSHI: What?
REED : The stream's too unstable.
TUCKER : Come on, Hoshi, come on.
REED : You can do it, Ensign.  It's as easy as one, two 
REED: Three.
TUCKER: Nice work, Malcolm. See, I told you. Piece of cake.
HOSHI: Where are they?  We've got to stop them.
TUCKER: Who?
HOSHI: You heard me? You can hear me? Do you see me?
REED: Everything's fine, Hoshi.
HOSHI:  It's not fine. They put a bomb on the warp  reactor.
TUCKER: Who?
HOSHI: The aliens from the surface.
TUCKER: There's no one on the surface. It's uninhabited.
HOSHI: What are you talking about? They kidnapped you and Travis. We've  got to stop them.
REED: Hoshi, the transporter was affected by the storms. I had some  trouble reintegrating your matter stream.
HOSHI: Trouble?
TUCKER: You were sort of, trapped in the pattern buffer. But only for a  few seconds.
REED: Eight point three seconds, to be precise.
HOSHI: Are you saying that I was just on the surface?
TUCKER: You insisted on going second.
HOSHI: Do you have a mirror?
REED: What?
HOSHI: Forget it. And I was sure I was going to be the next Cyrus  Ramsey.
TUCKER: Cyrus who?
HOSHI: So you're saying  all of that happened in eight seconds?
PHLOX: Actually, it probably happened in the last one or two seconds as  your matter stream was coalescing. She seems fine.
ARCHER: Malcolm is recommending some new transport protocols to Star  Fleet. He's suggesting we start compressing the transport beam.
HOSHI: Well, I hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a long  time.
ARCHER: But you said you stepped on to the aliens' transporter by  choice.
HOSHI: I was trying to save Enterprise.
ARCHER: Sounds like you overcame your fear.
HOSHI: It's all in my head, remember?
ARCHER: Does it matter? You were afraid of getting lost, afraid of  disappearing, but you still climbed on to that platform, real or not.
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd like to stick to  shuttlepods for the time being.
ARCHER: Come on. Let's go to the Bridge.
HOSHI: Captain, if you don't mind.
