T'POL  : Previously on Enterprise
LIEUTENANT: We have complete access.
REED: They're preparing to launch.
ARCHER: She's been inside the weapon. I have to know what she saw. Have  her taken aboard Degra's ship right away.
T'POL: We have a plan to disable Sphere Forty One.
TUCKER: If we're right, it should disrupt the entire network.
DOLIM: If they had made us the dominant species  before the wars our homeworld would still exist.
SOLDIER: And our avian brothers would still fill the skies.
DOLIM: We should be grateful that the Guardians have finally come to  their senses. Once Earth is destroyed, the reptilians will take their  rightful place at the head of a new Xindi empire.
HUMANOID: They're nearly three hours ahead of us,  but this vessel is faster. We're closing the gap.
REED: It may be faster but it's not well-armed. How many ships are  escorting the weapon?
HUMANOID: I can't tell.
ARCHER: The only way we're going to be able to destroy this thing is  from the inside. Any luck?
JANNAR: All of Degra's schematics are encrypted.
ARCHER: We're going to need Hoshi to help us.
REED: She's in no condition to come up here.
ARCHER: I wish I had a choice, Malcolm.
REED: Sir, she's barely conscious.
ARCHER: Can you transfer that to a PADD? Something portable?
PRESAGE: The favourable timelines continue to  diminish.
BUILDER: They should be increasing. The weapon has almost reached it's  target.
PRIMARY: But the Earth ship is on course for our primary Sphere.  Accelerate the transformation around that Sphere. They mustn't be  allowed to intervene.
T'POL: Report.
TUCKER: We've realigned the main power grid. It should increase the  deflector pulse threefold, maybe four, but it's going to fry just about  every system on board.
T'POL: Be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours.
TUCKER: I don't think you heard what I just said. We try this and the  ship's going to come apart at the seams.
T'POL: Two hours, Mister Tucker.
TUCKER: The Captain told the Xindi we'd try to knock these things out.  He didn't say anything about demolishing Enterprise in the process.
T'POL: Has it occurred to you what's going to happen if Captain Archer  fails? If Earth is destroyed?
TUCKER: Every day.
T'POL: Good. Then you've already come to the conclusion that without  humanity there's no one to combat these Sphere Builders. Their Expanse  will continue to grow, encompassing one system after another, including  Vulcan. Your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy. Two hours.
TRAVIS: I think we've got a problem.
T'POL: What is it?
TRAVIS: Sphere Forty One.
T'POL: Are you certain these are the coordinates?
TRAVIS: Yep. There shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the  cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger.
T'POL: Have you analysed it?
TRAVIS: Could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter  than we've ever seen them.
PHLOX: They're transforming the space around that  Sphere. Not unlike the disturbance where we found that  trans-dimensional being. They obviously expected us.
T'POL: If we're going to disable the network we'll need to get within a  kilometre of the surface.
PHLOX: If the ship were to enter that disturbance, the entire crew  would be dead within minutes. I could synthesise a neuraleptic compound  that would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes. I'm  afraid there's nothing I can do to prevent epidermal decay.
T'POL: Twelve minutes won't be enough.
PHLOX: Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much. I encourage you and  Mister Tucker to encourage alternatives. There must be something you  can do to abbreviate your plan.
ARCHER: Any luck? Ensign?
HOSHI: I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you can get Phlox to  come down here?
ARCHER: We're on Degra's ship, Hoshi. Phlox isn't here.
HOSHI: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.
ARCHER: The schematics for the weapon. Degra encrypted them before he  was killed. You've been trying to decipher them.
HOSHI: I gave them the third code. They wouldn't have been able to arm  the weapon if I hadn't given them the third code.
ARCHER: You were drugged, Hoshi. You had no choice.
HOSHI: I did. I should have fought harder.
ARCHER: You need to finish what you're doing. You're almost there.  We're going to board the weapon, try to overload the power systems, but  we can't do that until we can read these schematics.
HOSHI: I tried to jump but I wasn't fast enough.
ARCHER: You need to finish this.
HOSHI: You've got the three codes so why don't you just kill me? Didn't  you say you're going to kill me?
ARCHER: You've got to pull yourself together just for a little while  longer. You need to complete the decryption. Everything hinges on it.  Do you understand?
HOSHI: I understand.
DOLIM: When we exit the vortex, how close will we  be?
LIEUTENANT: Approximately two million kilometres from Earth.
DOLIM: Two million!
LIEUTENANT: If we had all five codes we could begin the firing sequence  immediately, but with three we'll need additional time. We'd be  vulnerable if we dropped into normal space any closer to the target.
DOLIM: Do what ever it takes to fire the weapon as quickly as possible.
TRAVIS: You wanted to see me, sir?
TUCKER: I think I've found a way to boost the deflector pulse without  tearing the ship apart, but it's going to mean transferring all impulse  power to the array.
TRAVIS: When?
TUCKER: As soon as we reach the Sphere.
TRAVIS: Sir.
TUCKER: Sorry, Travis. You're going to have to get us to the manifold  on thrusters only.
TRAVIS: That's tying my hands, Commander, especially with the ticking  clock.
TUCKER: You can do it. Look over these schematics, familiarise yourself  with the features of the Sphere.
REED: We won't be able to transport directly onto  the control platform, it's too heavily shielded. We'll have to beam in  and out no deeper than this peripheral framework.
HUMANOID: What if you need to board the weapon before your crewman  completes her decryptions?
ARCHER: I'm taking her with me.
REED: Sir, she's hardly in any shape
ARCHER: She's been there, Malcolm. That's where she deciphered that  third launch code.
REED: She was drugged. There's no reason to believe that she'll  remember anything.
ARCHER: She's coming with me. I want you and your team to beam in right  before we do. Secure the closest route to the platform.
ARCHER: I'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework.  You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi.
REED: And you, sir?
ARCHER: I've no plans of dying on that weapon, Malcolm. I'm going to  see what else she's come up with.
DANIELS: This is a very important day, Jonathan.
ARCHER: I don't have time for this.
DANIELS: It'll only take a minute. You see the fellow in the blue  jacket, near the left hand of the dais? That's you, a little more than  seven years from now. You and the others are about to make history. Do  you remember I told you about a Federation?
ARCHER: What about it?
DANIELS: I work with some people who are going to be pretty angry with  me for telling you this, but you're going to be an integral part of  forming that Federation. You're down there, right now, with Vulcans,  Andorians and Tellarites, getting ready to sign the Charter. The  membership is going to grow. Dozen, eventually hundreds of species. A  United Federation of Planets.
ARCHER: I have a team preparing to board the weapon. I've got other  things to think about right now.
DANIELS: Let Reed or one of the others go to the control platform.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
DANIELS: It's too great a risk. If you're killed, none of this will  happen. At least, not the way it's supposed to happen.
ARCHER: Then it'll happen some other way. Who's to say whether it'll be  better or worse?
DANIELS: It's essential you be a part of this.
ARCHER: Where are we? What planet?
DANIELS: Earth.
ARCHER: Seems to me it's just as essential that Earth be around for  this too.
DANIELS: Lieutenant Reed can work with Sato.   They are not crucial to the future of mankind. You are.
ARCHER: My mission is to save Earth, not your Federation.
DANIELS: You can't ignore your place in history.
ARCHER: My place is on that control platform. Now get me the hell back  to Degra's ship.
PHLOX:  And if it's not too  much of an inconvenience, I'd appreciate it if you'd contact my first  wife's third husband, Groznik. Tell him that he's welcome to keep the  Aldebaran drum set I loaned him. Oh, they have a child named Indaura, a  sweet little girl, she must be eight or nine by now. Well, I would like  to leave her my botanical library. She always had a flair for plants.  Computer, pause recording. Everything's ready here.
T'POL: Commander Tucker has completed his modifications to the  deflector. I apologise if I interrupted you.
PHLOX: Oh no, don't be silly. I was simply dictating a letter to my  colleague, Doctor Lucas. He offered to make sure my affairs were in  order in the event that, er, well, you know.
T'POL: I have always found it distracting to think of death, especially  when entering a dangerous situation.
PHLOX: Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. I don't know about  Vulcans, but Denobulans take great pleasure in bequeathing their  belongings to far-flung relatives.
T'POL: We're not dead yet.
TRAVIS : Bridge to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
TRAVIS : We're approaching the co-ordinates.
T'POL: Take us out of warp. Hope for the best, Doctor.
TRAVIS: It's grown. It's a hundred thousand  kilometres deeper than when we first detected it.
PHLOX:  I've enhanced the neuraleptic compound as  much as I can. I strongly advise we remain in the disturbance no longer  than fifteen minutes.
T'POL: Are you ready to release the compound? Then proceed. Stand by to  charge the deflector. Set a course, Ensign.
HOSHI: What have you guys figured out?
ARCHER: We've got to disable the reactor at a specific point during the  inversion sequence, but we don't know the sequence. If it's not done in  the right order, internal safeguards will kick in and it'll be  impossible to create an overload.
HOSHI: I've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. Your  friend Degra didn't make this easy.
ARCHER: I wish I could tell you to take your time.
HOSHI: The first time you came to visit me in Brazil.
ARCHER: It didn't stop raining for a week.
HOSHI: I had a bug then, too. A tropical bacterium not a reptilian  parasite. I was sick as a dog but I wanted to make a good impression.
ARCHER: When we get back home I'll see to it you get some R+R in Norway  or Canada. Someplace where there's not a tropical bug in sight.
HOSHI: Or reptiles.
ARCHER: Or reptiles. Keep at it. I'll get these to the Bridge.
JANNAR: We've gotten close enough to isolate their  signatures.
HUMANOID: The Insectoid ship is no longer with them.
ARCHER: Why would they leave the vortex?
JANNAR: We have no idea. All we know is that the weapon is being  escorted by a single Reptilian vessel. Dolim's.
REED: At least we'll only have one ship to contend with.
TRAVIS: Here we go.
T'POL: Doctor?
PHLOX: Fifteen minutes and counting.
T'POL: Any sign of the Sphere?
TRAVIS: It's too soon.
T'POL: Hold your course.
SOLDIER: Degra's vessel is less than twenty  minutes behind us.
DOLIM: Lieutenant, we're about to drop into normal space.
DOLIM : Stand by to initiate the firing  sequence.
LIEUTENANT: We're ready.
DOLIM: Are you detecting any Earth vessels near  the co-ordinates?
SOLDIER: No vessels, but there is one small orbital station. Unarmed.
DOLIM: Let me see Earth.
DOLIM: Enlarge. It's a shame. All that water. The Aquatics would feel  at home here.
TRAVIS: I've got it.
T'POL: How far?
TRAVIS: Twenty thousand kilometres.
PHLOX: Thirteen minutes left.
T'POL: As soon as we make visual contact, go to thrusters. Set a  heading to latitude fifteen degrees north. Deflector?
TUCKER:  Standing by.
JANNAR: They're eight hundred thousand kilometres ahead.
ARCHER: Get your team ready to go.
REED: Aye sir.
HUMANOID: Dolim's changing course. They're heading for a space station.
ARCHER: Are we in visual range?  Yosemite Three.
JANNAR: A military installation?
ARCHER: A research post. Usually thirty to forty civilians aboard. Hail  them on this frequency.
HUMANOID: The weapon's emitting disruption waves. I can't get anything  through.
TRAVIS: Fifteen degrees north.
T'POL: Drop to two thousand metres. Track starboard, eighty two mark  zero.
TRAVIS: Aye.
TUCKER: Doc, there's something weird happening to my skin.
TRAVIS: Me too.
PHLOX: It was expected. Try not to scratch it. Eleven minutes  remaining.
DOLIM: The Guardian said that once Earth is gone  we're to destroy all human colonies. I see no reason not to begin with  this station. Target. Fire when ready.
JANNAR: They're heading back towards the weapon.
T'POL: Ten degrees port. Slow to thirty kph. I'm  transferring the target point to the deflector array.
TUCKER: Got it.
T'POL: Begin.
TUCKER: Fish in a barrel.
PHLOX: Less than ten minutes to go.
TUCKER: What the hell's going on? Power just fell ten percent.
TRAVIS: I'm picking up explosions on E deck.
T'POL: Bridge to Engineering. Report.
TUCKER: I'm losing the beam.
PHLOX: There are nine alien lifesigns aboard. They appear to be  transdimensional beings.
TRAVIS: How's that possible?
PHLOX: This disturbance we're in, it's obviously been altered enough to  sustain them.
DOLIM: Who's on Degra's ship?
SOLDIER: Eight primates, three arboreals and seven humans.
DOLIM: Have their weapons been upgraded?
SOLDIER: No, sir.
DOLIM: Pathetic. Prepare to intercept.
JANNAR: They're arming their torpedoes.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: How's Hoshi doing?
REED: She's holding up. She and the MACO's are at the transporter  device.
ARCHER:  Remember, no heroics. Just get us in and  then keep them off your ass.
JANNAR: There's another vessel approaching at high warp. They're asking  for you.
SHRAN : You're not using your head, pinkskin. That ship  you're on is no match for the reptilian.
ARCHER: I'm busy, Shran. What are you doing here?
SHRAN : You should be impressed we managed to track you  through the vortex. I anticipated that you'd need some help.
KELLY : Corporal Kelly to the Bridge.
T'POL: Go ahead.
KELLY : Our weapons are passing right through them.
TUCKER: You've got to stop this. If I don't get full power back this is  going to take three, four minutes longer than we've got.
PHLOX: We can't afford three or four minutes. Corporal Kelly, listen to  me very closely. Modulate your weapons to a rotating frequency of  thirty two point six teracycles.
T'POL: Doctor.
PHLOX: Our transdimensional friend, the one we found in the pod, I had  quite a few hours to study his physiology. Let's hope my memory serves  me well.
SHRAN: I'll be right in front of you, gentlemen.
SHRAN : Keep a low profile.
HUMANOID: We're matching speed.
DOLIM: You said there were no human vessels in the  vicinity.
SOLDIER: They're not human.
DOLIM: Destroy them both.
SHRAN: That third torpedo almost got you. Be careful! Prepare to come  about to port.
SHRAN : Stay below me.
HUMANOID: We'll need to get within a kilometre of the weapon.
SHRAN : Just stay below me.
SHRAN: Let's fight back this time, shall we. Bring  the forward cannons online.
SHRAN : Go!
SHRAN: And tell Archer we're not even any more. He  owes me!
TUCKER: It's coming back. Tell them to keep doing  what they're doing.
WALKER : Walker to the Bridge.
T'POL: Go ahead.
WALKER : We've secured Engineering but I don't think we've seen the  last of them.
PHLOX: It's time for you to work your magic, Mister Tucker. Within five  minutes, everyone on this ship is going to start dying.
TUCKER: No pressure.
ARCHER: Okay, bring up the inversion sequence.
HOSHI: Start with the third one from the left.
ARCHER: Got it.
HOSHI: The second from the right.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: I'm all right. The first one on the left is next.
SOLDIER: Commander, sensors show the humans are no  longer aboard Degra's vessel.
DOLIM: These ships are drawing us away from the weapon. Get us back!
TUCKER: What's going on?
PHLOX: Ignore it Commander. You've got less than two minutes.
ARCHER: Got it. Two to go.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
REED:  Reed to Archer.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
REED: I'm pretty sure that was the last one, sir.
ARCHER : Good work. Now get back here.
PHLOX: T'Pol. T'Pol!
T'POL: All right. Take us to full impulse. Get us out of here.
TUCKER: Wait a minute, I'm almost there.
PHLOX: You don't have a minute, Commander!
TUCKER: Give me ten seconds. I'm telling you I've got it.
PHLOX: That's it, times up.
TUCKER: It sure is.
T'POL: Now, Mister Mayweather.
T'POL: The network is being destroyed.
MAYWEATHER: Looks like we're getting out of this soup faster than we  thought.
PHLOX: Without the Spheres, their transformed space must be collapsing  in on itself.
ARCHER: Which one, Hoshi?
HOSHI: Number four. The fourth one from the left.
REED: Are you sure?
HOSHI: Yes, yes. Number five is the last one after you disable the  reactor.
REED: But if we knock the reactor out, won't that be enough?
ARCHER: We didn't come here to disable this weapon, we're here to  destroy it. Give me the charges.
REED: I'll take care of it, sir.
ARCHER: I want the four of you to get to the outer framework. Beam back  to Degra's ship.
REED: As Chief Tactical Officer, sir
ARCHER: This isn't open for debate, Lieutenant.
ARCHER: Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.
DOLIM: What have you done!
CREWMAN: One Reptilian transported to the weapon.
SHRAN: Let's make sure he has nowhere to go back to. They have no  shielding on their starboard engines. Target all weapons.
REED: Can you get a lock on him?
HUMANOID: Not yet.
JANNAR: Your Captain is too deep within the weapon.
T'POL : Acting Captain's starlog, February  14th, 2152. We're holding position at the coordinates where we were  told to meet Degra's vessel. So far there's been no word from them.
T'POL: Long range sensors are detecting no  evidence of the Spheres.
TUCKER: None of them?
T'POL: None. And all the spatial anomalies within our scanning range  have vanished.
TUCKER: What about the thermobaric cloud barrier?
T'POL: I can only detect a small section from our location, but it  appears to be dissipating.
TUCKER: Looks like we kept our end of the bargain.
T'POL: It would appear that the Expanse is returning to normal space.
TUCKER: We should have heard something by now. What if they failed?  Earth could be
T'POL: Be patient.
TUCKER: My skin's healing faster than yours. I guess you Vulcans aren't  so tough after all.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox says we should all be back to normal within two to  three days.
TUCKER: I'm only kidding. You look nice like this. Kind of like an old  oil painting.
T'POL: I'm not old. I will only be sixty six years old on my next  birthday.
TUCKER: I can't believe you told me that.
T'POL: You accused me of looking old.
TUCKER: That's not what I mean. I've been trying to get you to tell me  your age since we left Spacedock. Why now?
T'POL: To Vulcans, certain information is considered intimate.
TUCKER: Intimate?
TRAVIS : Bridge to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
TRAVIS : A vortex just opened. It's Degra's ship.
T'POL: This is Enterprise. Please repeat.
TUCKER: Captain, did you stop the weapon?   Captain?
T'POL: Set an intercept course.
REED: It's done.
T'POL: Done?
REED: Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.
TUCKER: Where is he? Is he okay?
REED: Captain didn't make it, Trip.
TUCKER: What do you mean, he didn't make it.
REED: The weapon exploded before he could transport to Degra's ship.
T'POL: Come in.  Thank you.
HUMANOID: The Aquatic vessel should have you home in less than a day.
T'POL: I was pleased to hear that the Council has agreed to reconvene,
HUMANOID: It was difficult for the Insectoids to ignore recent events.
T'POL: And the Reptilians?
HUMANOID: They'll join us eventually. They have no choice but to accept  that the Guardians' promises were empty. Your Captain's sacrifice will  not be forgotten. Safe journey.
T'POL: Thank you.
PHLOX:  It's all right. All  right, it won't be much longer. I promise.
T'POL: Is something wrong?
PHLOX: I think they sense that we're travelling in an unusual manner.  In the belly of the beast, so to speak.
T'POL: There are no windows here. How would they know we're inside the  Aquatic vessel?
PHLOX: I don't have the slightest idea. I doubt I'll get much peace and  quiet around here until we're flying under our own power.
T'POL: It will only be a few more hours.
PHLOX: Is there something I can do for you?
T'POL:  My skin hasn't fully healed yet.
PHLOX: Oh, you're doing fine. Vulcan's are obviously more sensitive to  the effects of mysterious realms.
T'POL: I guess we're not so tough after all.
PHLOX: Excuse me?
T'POL: Is there anything I'll need to treat this?
PHLOX: Only time. How's morale?
T'POL: It isn't easy for a crew to lose it's Captain.
PHLOX: I suppose we'll all need time to heal.
T'POL: Will he be all right?
PHLOX: After a while. He's lost his best friend, but it's just a matter  of time. He'll be fine again.
T'POL: Did you hear that? The Doctor say's you'll be fine. It's just a  matter of time.
T'POL: Distance?
TRAVIS: Eight hundred thousand kilometres.
T'POL: Set a course, Ensign.
T'POL: You should be in your quarters.
HOSHI: With all due respect to Phlox, I wouldn't miss this for the  world.
TUCKER:  Mind if we take a look?
TUCKER: Prettiest sight I ever saw. It's all in one piece.
REED: The Captain would be proud.
T'POL: Open a channel to Starfleet Headquarters.
HOSHI: Strange.
TUCKER: What?
HOSHI: They're not responding.
REED: You'd think they'd be waiting with bated breath.
T'POL: Try another frequency.
TRAVIS: I'm not picking up the orbital platforms.
REED: The Reptilians destroyed Yosemite Station.
TRAVIS: It's not just Yosemite. There's nothing coming from any of  them.
HOSHI: I've rotated through all the frequencies.
T'POL: Contact the Lunar One colony.
HOSHI: I already tried.
T'POL:  Prepare a shuttlepod. I want you and Ensign  Mayweather to get down to San Francisco. Find out what's wrong.
TRAVIS: Looks pretty normal to me.
TUCKER: Then why the hell doesn't anyone want to talk to us? Land at  the pad behind the Command Centre.
TRAVIS: Finally. We've got three vessels approaching.
TUCKER: It's about time. This is Commander Charles Tucker of the  Starship Enterprise. You guys gave us quite a   What the hell? 
TRAVIS: Sir.
OFFICER: Where is he?
DOCTOR: Follow me. He was brought in yesterday. He's been badly burned.   Do you recognise the uniform?
