VIC: Sure I remember the Alamo.
BASHIR: See? Told you he would.
VIC: Laurence Harvey, Richard Widmark and John Wayne as Davy Crockett.  Great battle scenes, nice sets, but way too long.
O'BRIEN: We're not talking about a movie.
BASHIR: No, we're talking about our holosuite programme.
VIC: Oh, that Alamo. What about it?
BASHIR: Well, we've got holosuite four reserved for an hour and we were  wondering whether you'd like to join us.
VIC: Look fellas, I'm touched by the offer, but I don't know.
O'BRIEN: We can transfer your matrix to the Alamo programme.
BASHIR: You've got to leave of Vegas sometimes, right?
VIC: True, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
BASHIR: Why?
VIC: I don't look good in buckskin. Tell you what I'll do though. How  about a little tune to get you into a Texas state of mind. Fellas,  Alamo.  Standing around by the Alamo. Walking around in San  Antonio. Looking around for a new kind of love.
VIC: Baby I'm lonesome tonight. History abounds by the famous fort.
MAN: Get him off!
MAN: Come on, step down, ya hack. Oh, honey. Show me, show me!
VIC: What the hell?
BASHIR: What is all this?
VIC: Don't ask me.
O'BRIEN: Maybe there's a pointer fault in the holosuite's parameter  file.
FRANKIE: Well, look who's here. The pretty boy singer himself.
VIC: Frankie Eyes. What are you doing in Vegas?
FRANKIE: What happened to 'Hello, Frankie, long time no see. Make  yourself at home. Can I get you anything?' You believe this guy?
CICCI:  No manners.
FRANKIE: Were you born in a barn or something?
BASHIR: This gentleman a friend of yours?
VIC: We know each other.
FRANKIE: We're a long way from South Philly, ain't we, Vic?
VIC: So, are you here on business or pleasure?
FRANKIE: Let's just say I'm here to stay, while you, Vicky boy, are  about to take a powder.
VIC: I'm not going anywhere.
FRANKIE: I got news for you, pal. I just bought this hotel. You're  history.
VIC: You can't fire me. I have a contract.
FRANKIE: And you can paper your walls with it. You're finished in this  town, Vic.
VIC: You're blackballing me?
FRANKIE: As of this moment, you couldn't get a job as a singing busboy.  Now are you going to walk out of here, or do you have to be carried  out? Makes no difference to me.
O'BRIEN: Let me handle this. Computer. Delete characters Frankie Eyes  and I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
CICCI: Cicci. 
O'BRIEN: And Cicci from the holosuite's programme.
CICCI: What's a holosuites?
FRANKIE: Beats me.
BASHIR: They're still here, Chief.
O'BRIEN: Computer, freeze programme. There must be a little problem in  the character deletion algorithm.
CICCI: I'll show you the door.
VIC: Make that a big problem.
FRANKIE: What's it going to be, pallie?
VIC: I guess I start packing.
FRANKIE: Smart boy. All right, Cicci, come on. Let's check out my  casino.
BASHIR: So what do we do now?
VIC: Nothing we can do. Frankie's a made man, capisce?
BASHIR: I'm not talking about Frankie, I'm talking about fixing the  entire programme.
O'BRIEN: Well, we could shut it down manually and reset it. But that  would wipe Vic's memory. He'd forget everything that's happened since  we first activated him.
VIC: Oh, hold on, pallie. Nobody's wiping my memory.
BASHIR: Of course not. There must be some other way.
O'BRIEN: I wish I knew what it was.
BASHIR: Better talk to Felix. After all, he was the one who designed  this programme.
VIC: You do that.
O'BRIEN: In the meantime, you stay out of the way of Frankie Eyes.
VIC: You'll get no argument from me.
NOG: I'll tell you one thing, if this Frankie Eyes  hurts Vic in any way, he's going to have to answer to me.
WORF: I do not understand how you could feel such loyalty for a  hologram.
NOG: He's not just a hologram, he's my friend.
O'BRIEN: Don't you like Vic?
WORF: As a singer, I find him entertaining. But beyond that, I neither  like him nor dislike him. He is a hologram, and therefore he does not  exist.
KIRA: He does for me.
BASHIR: I just talked to Felix. I know what's been affecting Vic's  programme. It's a jack in the box.
NOG: A what?
O'BRIEN: A jack in the box. It's a children's toy on Earth. You wind it  up and a figure jumps out and goes Boo!
BASHIR: Except this type of jack in the box is different.
NOG: It doesn't go Boo?
BASHIR: No, this surprise is buried deep in the holosuite programme.
O'BRIEN: It's meant to shake things up, you know? Make things  interesting.
NOG: I wasn't bored. Were you?
KIRA: Not at all. I liked Vic's the way it was.
BASHIR: According to Felix, if we get rid of Frankie Eyes, everything  resets back to the way it was.
KIRA: That's good to know.
NOG: So how do we get rid of Frankie Eyes?
BASHIR: That's up to us. But Felix did warn me the programme is period  specific.
O'BRIEN: In other words, if we shoot him, we have to use a forty five  automatic and not a phaser.
BASHIR: We can't shoot Frankie, it's too dangerous.
O'BRIEN: The mob could retaliate against Vic.
BASHIR: If anything happens to Vic, his matrix will be eliminated from  the programme. Permanently.
NOG: The news just keeps getting better, doesn't it?
SISKO: What news?
KIRA: Oh, nothing, sir. We're talking about a holosuite programme.
BASHIR: Vic Fontaine's hotel's just been bought by gangsters.
SISKO: I see. When do you plan on to going back to work?
O'BRIEN: Right away, sir.
NOG: Whatever you decide to do, Chief, count me in. I owe Vic. I  thought losing my leg was the end of my Starfleet career. He taught me  otherwise.
KIRA: He changed my life, too. And Odo's.
BASHIR: Now all we need is a plan.
KASIDY: Your daddy would be proud.
SISKO: My daddy taught me everything I know.
KASIDY: How nice.
SISKO: So, how was your day?
KASIDY: It's getting better.
SISKO: Something happen?
KASIDY: It's Vic.
SISKO: Vic?
KASIDY: Vic Fontaine. A gangster named Frankie Eyes took over his  lounge. The whole place has changed and no one's sure how to change it  back. What?
SISKO: Nothing.
KASIDY: I guess this sounds pretty silly to you.
SISKO: A little.
KASIDY: You have to understand, Vic isn't just another holosuite  programme. He's more like a friend.
SISKO: Kasidy, can we talk about something else?
KASIDY: Sure. How come you've never been to Vic's?
SISKO: Does it matter? You like going there and I don't. Let's leave it  at that.
KASIDY: I was only asking.
SISKO: And I gave you my answer.
KASIDY: There are times when I just can't figure you out.
SISKO: Well, maybe that's part of the attraction.
KASIDY: Believe that if you want to.
VIC : Who is it?
O'BRIEN: It's Miles and Julian.
VIC : Just a minute.
VIC: You wouldn't happen to have an ice pack on you, would you?
VIC: Hey, pallie, whose side are you on?
BASHIR: I'm sorry, but you have three bruised ribs here and your left  wrist is sprained. The good news is your skull is still in one piece.
BASHIR: Thanks.
VIC: I feel better already. A jack in the box. I can't believe Felix  would do that to me.
BASHIR: Oh, don't take it personally. He was just trying to do me a  favour by not letting things get too boring.
VIC: I thought that was my job.
BASHIR: Oh, and you're great at it. You know we love ya.
O'BRIEN: So, you going to tell us what happened?
VIC: I slipped in the bathtub.
O'BRIEN: And knocked over this furniture looking for a bandage, right?
VIC: Something like that. Frankie sent Tony Cicci to pay me a little  visit. He wanted to remind me not to take too long packing.
O'BRIEN: What is it with you and Frankie?
VIC: It goes back to the old neighbourhood when we were kids. I used to  beat him at stickball.
BASHIR: And?
VIC: And nothing. We've been rivals ever since.
O'BRIEN: That Felix, huh. When he designs a holosuite programme, he  doesn't fool around.
VIC: Tell me about it.
BASHIR: Now you should get some rest. Maybe take a little vacation.
VIC: A vacation? Did you guys take a vacation when the Dominion took  over DS Nine?
O'BRIEN: It's not the same thing.
VIC: It is to me. This is my life, remember? I don't run at the first  sign of trouble.
BASHIR: We're not asking you to run anywhere. We just want you to stay  out of sight while we come up with a plan.
VIC: What plan?
O'BRIEN: How to get rid of Frankie Eyes.
BASHIR: Odo and Kira are down in the lounge right now.
VIC: Doing what?
O'BRIEN: Checking up on Frankie. We need to find his weak spot.
VIC: I hope you know what you're getting me into. If you guys screw up,  I'm the one who winds up buried in the desert.
KIRA: Let me guess, you'll look around here while I check out the  casino?
ODO: Oh. Er. If you'd prefer, I'll go and
KIRA: Enjoy yourself. Just remember, we have a job to do.
ODO: Of course.
CICCI: Then I drive him out to the woods. Badda bing badda bang. Three  in back of the head, that's the end of little Paulie. So what do you  think Frankie says when I report back in? Little Paulie? Nah, I told  you to pop Big Paulie! That's the problem with our business, too many  guys named Paulie.
KIRA: Hit me.  I'm done.
FRANKIE: Not so fast. What kind of card is that to give such a pretty  lady. Hit her again.
KIRA: Isn't that against the rules?
FRANKIE: Don't worry about it. Double your bet.
FRANKIE: Twenty six? What's wrong with you? Again.  You're  starting to aggravate me, pal.  Twenty one, finally. Pay the  lady.
DEALER: Yes, sir.
FRANKIE: If I were you, I'd quit while I was ahead. The name's Frank  Chalmers, but everyone calls me Frankie Eyes.
KIRA: Why's that?
FRANKIE: Because I don't miss a trick.
KIRA: You're very sure of yourself.
FRANKIE: Doubt is for losers.
KIRA: And quite a philosopher.
FRANKIE: Well, I'm thinking of writing a book.
KIRA: What's the title?
FRANKIE: Well, maybe you can help me think one up.
KIRA: My talents lie in other directions.
FRANKIE: Good title. Mind if I use it?
KIRA: I'd say you already paid for it.
FRANKIE: So what do you say we hit the roulette table and see if I  can't buy Chapter One.
CICCI: Hey, Max, Max, come over here. I want you to  see this.
CICCI: Can you believe it? He did it again. Buddy, I've been hanging  out in bars for twenty years. I ain't never seen a stunt like that.
ODO: There's nothing to it, really.
CICCI: Hear that? The guy's the eighth wonder of the world and he says  there's nothing to it. So where you from again?
ODO: Bajor.
CICCI: That's in Jersey, right?
ODO: Right.
CICCI: Max, Max, another round for my friend here.
ODO: Turns out Frankie Eyes was sent to Vegas by a man named Carl  Zeemo.
VIC: Looks like Frankie's moving up in the world.
KIRA: You know Mister Zeemo?
VIC: Been around forever. Likes to pretend he's a sweet old man, but  he's meaner than a junkyard dog. It's is all starting to make sense. I  knew Frankie didn't have the money to buy a hotel.
EZRI: But Zeemo does.
VIC: More than enough. This is going to be a pretty sweet deal for him.  The casino's bringing in about a million bucks a month. Cash. And out  of that, Zeemo expects to be sent a couple of hundred grand.
ODO: That would be the skim.
VIC: Right off the top. Tax free. Frankie's got nothing to worry about.  All he's got to do is send Mister Zeemo his cut.
KIRA: According to Frankie, Mister Zeemo's coming into town in about  six days to pick up his first payment. He's never been to Vegas and he  wants to look over his newest acquisition.
O'BRIEN: What would happen to Frankie if he didn't give Zeemo his skim?
VIC: Frankie's not that dumb.
BASHIR: Miles, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
O'BRIEN: That depends on what you're thinking.
BASHIR: All we have to do is see to it that Mister Zeemo doesn't sees a  penny of that money.
EZRI: Are you talking about robbing the casino?
O'BRIEN: That's what I was thinking.
KASIDY: Isn't that dangerous?
VIC: Stealing from the mob? You bet it is. You get caught and I kiss  the world goodbye.
O'BRIEN: Then the trick is not to get caught.
VIC: You guys are nuts, you know that? Besides, the money's kept in a  safe.
NOG: What kind of safe?
VIC: I don't know. It's in the countroom and there's a guard outside  the door twenty four hours a day. And even if you did get past him,  there's still that little problem of the two countmen inside.
KIRA: I'll get a look at the safe.
BASHIR: We'll figure out a way to take out the guard.
KASIDY: And the countmen.
EZRI: And anything else that comes along.
O'BRIEN: Then we're agreed?
BASHIR: Absolutely.
KIRA: I'm in.
ODO: Me, too.
KASIDY: Sure.
EZRI: Okay.
NOG: Let's do it.
VIC: Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You're going to knock  over the casino and swipe a cool million from the mob?
O'BRIEN: Vic, you want your lounge back or not?
VIC: Deal me in.
FRANKIE: Have you ever seen a prettier shade of green?
KIRA: Looks like you had a profitable night.
FRANKIE: And the night's not over.
KIRA: Is this for me or am I just keeping it warm for you?
FRANKIE: It's all yours, baby. And there's more where that came from.
KIRA: I'll take your word for it.
FRANKIE: What are you looking at?
AL: Nothing.
FRANKIE: Just keep counting. After you, sweetheart.
KASIDY: Are you sure you didn't go to high school in Asheville, North  Carolina?
GUARD: Yeah, I'm positive.
KASIDY: That's funny. You look just like the captain of our football  team. I had such a crush on him.
GUARD: Well, actually, I did play a little football.
KASIDY: I knew it. You have the body of an athlete.
CICCI: You call this a cheesesteak? I wouldn't feed  this to my parole officer.
ODO: Excuse me, Cicci. Could I have a word with you?
CICCI: Just a second, please. Now I want a cheesesteak and I don't care  if you got to fly to Philadelphia to get me one.
CICCI: A guy can starve to death in this town.
ODO: Ezri, this is Tony Cicci.
EZRI: Nice to meet you.
CICCI: The pleasure is all mine.
ODO: Ezri's new in town. She needs a job.
EZRI: I'm a very good waitress.
CICCI: Ah. You wouldn't happen to have a slice of pizza on you?
EZRI: No, but I could go the kitchen and get you one.
CICCI: That chef wouldn't know a good pizza if it hit him right in the  face. Consider yourself gainfully employed.
EZRI: Really? That's wonderful.
ODO: Thanks, Cicci. I owe you one.
CICCI: Ah, don't mention it, Stretch. Maybe one of these days you'll  show me the
CICCI: I don't believe it.
VIC: Take it easy, pallie. Take it easy. I'm not looking for trouble.
CICCI: That's a relief.
VIC: I'm here to see Frankie. I want to try to work things out with  him. You know, let bygones be bygones.
VIC: Frankie, I'm dying here. The Sands, the Dunes,  the DI, no one will even return my call.
FRANKIE: Tell me something I don't know.
VIC: There's got to be a way for us to bury the hatchet.
FRANKIE: I already did. In your head.
VIC: Frankie you want me to beg? I'll beg. Give me a chance to make  things right. I know people, people with dough. High rollers. I could  bring 'em into the casino.
FRANKIE: What? You want to be my shill?
VIC: I'm talking about people who can drop ten, twenty, thirty big ones  a night.
KIRA: Give him what he wants, Frankie. I can't take much more of his  whining.
FRANKIE: Bring in a couple of players, then we'll talk.
VIC: That's all I ask. Let me buy you a drink.
FRANKIE: I don't drink with losers. Come on, dollface. Let's warm up  the poker table.
CICCI: Welcome back.
SISKO: You're in charge of what?
KASIDY: Of distracting the guard so that we can sneak someone into the  countroom.
SISKO: Kasidy, I can't believe you're involved in this thing. The whole  thing is ridiculous.
KASIDY: I guess that means you're not going to wish me luck.
SISKO: And you're telling me that virtually my entire senior staff is a  part of this nonsense?
KASIDY: You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.  And Vic, hologram or not, is in trouble. Not that I'd expect you to  care.
SISKO: Look, this is not about Vic Fontaine.
KASIDY: Then what is your problem?
SISKO: You want to know? You really want to know what my problem is?  I'll tell you. Las Vegas nineteen sixty two, that's my problem. In  nineteen sixty two, black people weren't very welcome there. Oh, sure  they could be performers or janitors, but customers? Never.
KASIDY: Maybe that's the way it was in the real Vegas, but that is not  the way it is at Vic's. I have never felt uncomfortable there and  neither has Jake.
SISKO: But don't you see, that's the lie. In nineteen sixty two, the  Civil Rights movement was still in its infancy. It wasn't an easy time  for our people and I'm not going to pretend that it was.
KASIDY: Baby, I know that Vic's isn't a totally accurate representation  of the way things were, but it isn't meant to be. It shows us the way  things could have been. The way they should've been.
SISKO: We cannot ignore the truth about the past.
KASIDY: Going to Vic's isn't going to make us forget who we are or  where we came from. What it does is it reminds us that we're no longer  bound by any limitations, except the ones we impose on ourselves.
KASIDY: What about Worf?
KIRA: Oh, he'll never agree to it.
EZRI: There's always Quark.
ODO: I'm not sure he'd help. He thinks of you as his competition.
NOG: I'll get it.
O'BRIEN: Better get this out of sight.
EZRI: There's one little problem. We're still one man short.
BASHIR: We need a high roller with Vic at the craps table. Someone to  gather a crowd, keep attention away from the countroom.
O'BRIEN: Otherwise the whole plan falls apart.
SISKO: And we certainly can't let that happen. Now, exactly what do you  need me to do?
VIC: Let's go over it one more time.
NOG: Do we have to? Everyone knows what they have to do, right?
EZRI: It's all pretty simple really.
VIC: Hey, far be it from me to tell Starfleet officers how to do their  jobs.
O'BRIEN: Robbing casinos isn't part of any Starfleet job description  I've ever read.
KIRA: We can't afford to make any mistakes.
SISKO: And we're not going to. Take us through it again.
VIC: You got it, pallie. It all begins with you.
VIC : Keeping Frankie Eyes away from the casino and the countroom.
VIC : Meanwhile, the Captain and I will be laying down some heavy  bread over at the craps table. Enough to draw a crowd.
SISKO : Where are we going to get that kind of money?
VIC : I put a little away for a rainy day. Now each night, at  precisely eleven forty five.
SISKO : Al, one of the countmen, takes a break to call home.
SISKO : He never varies his routine. He's gone for eight minutes  every night.
VIC : During those six minutes, Howard, the other countman, has a  martini brought in.
EZRI : That's where I come in. But first, I make a stop at poker  table three where I hand a drink to Julian.
BASHIR : And I slip a few drops of ipecac into Howard's.
EZRI : After which, I continue on to the countroom.
EZRI : I set the tray down and leave.
VIC : Once Ezri's out of the countroom
KASIDY : I go running up to the guard and tell him Chief O'Brien  has stolen my chips.
VIC : Do whatever you need to do to keep him distracted. And don't  be afraid to turn on the waterworks. And Chief, you play innocent.
O'BRIEN : I am innocent! I've never seen this woman before in my  life.
VIC : That's the ticket. Now remember, the two of you have to keep  that guard away from the door for at least two minutes.
BASHIR : Once he takes a sip of his drink, Howard'll come flying  out of that countroom at warp speed.
NOG : Which is where I come in.
VIC : You and those fabulous Ferengi ears of  yours.
NOG : And once I've opened the safe.
ODO : you'll need someplace to put all that money.
VIC : You're going to be surprised how much a million bucks weighs.
ODO : I think I can handle it.
VIC : When you walk into the casino, don't talk  to anyone. Don't even look at anyone. And whatever you do, don't run.  Just head for the exit and dump the cash in the garbage cans outside.  With no money, there's no skim to give to Mister Zeemo, and old Frankie  becomes yesterday's news.
BASHIR : And everything returns to normal
BASHIR: And we pop open the champagne.
VIC: Music to my ears, pallie.
SISKO: Eight minutes. That's how long we have to get into the  countroom, open the safe, grab the money, and then get out again.
BASHIR: I bet we do it in five.
NOG: When do we pull off the caper?
KASIDY: The sooner, the better.
EZRI: Zeemo's due in two days.
SISKO: Then we have no choice. We go tomorrow night.
VIC: Hey. Crazy.
O'BRIEN: That was fast.
BASHIR: It has to be.
EZRI: Two minutes, fourteen seconds.
NOG: I've got to do a lot better than that.
EZRI: Right.
NOG:  Go.
KASIDY: Better finish getting dressed. It's almost time.
QUARK: I'm telling you, Morn. Something's going on  in Vic's that we don't know about.
FRANKIE: Looking good, as usual, dollface.
KIRA: I'm glad you like what you see.
FRANKIE: I only wish I could see more.
KIRA: Well you know what they say, good things come to those who wait.
FRANKIE: Who are they and how much of you have they seen?
KIRA: I never kiss and tell.
FRANKIE: I bet you don't.
KASIDY: Oh, nineteen. Let's if see you can beat that.
KASIDY: Twenty three. You're busted.
BASHIR: Vodka martini. Stirred, not shaken.
EZRI: Right away, sir.
ROULETTE: Winner seventeen black.
SISKO: Ten thousand.
CROUPIER: Good luck to you, sir. Make your bets. High low bets.
VIC: A hundred dollars?
SISKO: Too much?
VIC: You're supposed to be a high roller, so start rolling. Make it two  thousand.
SISKO: Two thousand.
FRANKIE: What do you say we blow some of my money  at the crap table?
KIRA: Maybe later. Right now, I want you to buy me a drink. We can play  footsies under the table.
FRANKIE: Footsies? I guess that's a start.
VIC: We have lift off.
EZRI: Oh, I'm so sorry.
BASHIR: Don't worry about it. You're too kind.
CROUPIER: Coming out now, new shooter.
SISKO: Here's where things get interesting. Come on, seven.
EZRI: You're not Howard.
COUNTMAN: He's out with the flu.
EZRI: Oh. This drink must be yours, then.
COUNTMAN: I'm not thirsty.
EZRI: But
COUNTMAN: Hey, you're making me lose count.
EZRI: Sorry. You mind if I drink that? I've been on my feet for hours  and I could really use a little pick me up.
COUNTMAN: That's about the saddest story I ever heard.
CROUPIER: Place your bets.
SISKO: Let it ride, let it ride.
KASIDY: You have to help me. That man. That man right there. He stole a  stack of my chips.
GUARD: Hey, you! Stop right there!
O'BRIEN: Who, me?
GUARD: The lady says you stole her chips.
O'BRIEN: I did no such thing.
KASIDY: Liar! I'm telling you, he took them. You're a thief!
O'BRIEN: And you're drunk,
KASIDY: I am not.
GUARD: Hey, hey, let's just calm down, okay?
KASIDY: Not until I get my money!
O'BRIEN: What money?
KASIDY: The money you stole.
O'BRIEN: I told you, I never touched your money.
KASIDY: Liar.
NOG: Uh oh.
ODO: What do you mean, uh oh. We don't have time for uh oh.
NOG: This safe. It has an auto-relock tumbler. Kira didn't mention  anything about an auto-relock tumbler.
ODO: Well she obviously didn't know about it.
NOG: We're not going to have enough time.
ODO: Keep working.
FRANKIE: This is the hand that shook the hand of  Bugsy Siegel, the man that built Las Vegas. I'm telling you, he was a  visionary. And is there even one statue of the guy in this town?
KIRA: There's no justice.
FRANKIE: You can say that again. Sure you don't want to play the tables  for a while?
KIRA: I'm perfectly content right here.
FRANKIE: Who am I to argue with a lady?
KASIDY: What are you standing around for? Arrest  him! I told you he took two hundred dollars worth of chips from me.
O'BRIEN: How come I've only got five bucks on me?
KASIDY: Don't believe him.
O'BRIEN: I'm telling you. This broad ain't playing with a full deck.
KASIDY: And just what is that supposed to mean?
O'BRIEN: What do you think it means?
SISKO: Beginner's luck. For the dealers.
VIC: Six minutes.
SISKO: I wonder what's taking them so long.
AL: I've got to go. I'm running late. This Frankie
FRANKIE: You in some kind of hurry?
KIRA: Me?
FRANKIE: You keep staring at that watch.
KIRA: Really? I hadn't noticed.
FRANKIE: And your drink. You haven't touched it.
KIRA: Oh, well, the night is young. I've got to pace myself.
FRANKIE: Pace yourself? For what?
CICCI: Frankie, there's someone here to see you.
FRANKIE: I'm busy.
ZEEMO: You don't look busy.
FRANKIE: Mister Zeemo. We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
ZEEMO: I'm early. Any problem with that?
FRANKIE: No, not at all. Sit down, have a drink.
ZEEMO: We'll have a drink later. Where's the er, where's the countroom.
FRANKIE: Follow me.
KIRA: Mister Zeemo. It's a great honour to meet you.
ZEEMO: I know.
KIRA: Frankie has told me so much about you.
ZEEMO: Frankie.
FRANKIE: Yeah.
ZEEMO: The money, Frankie.
FRANKIE: Right this way.
ZEEMO: Let's go. Come on.
ODO: Nog, it's been eight minutes. We're running  out of time.
BASHIR: I fold. Excuse me. Your name's Al, right?
AL: Who wants to know?
BASHIR: Frankie Eyes.
AL: Frankie Eyes?
BASHIR: He's waiting for you out back.
AL: For what? I didn't do nothing.
BASHIR: Then you have nothing to worry about.
VIC: You gotta be kidding me
SISKO: Now what? Zeemo!
VIC: He's a day early. Keep playing, I'll try to stall them.
VIC: Nina? Nina, is that you?
ZEEMO: Who's this?
FRANKIE: Nobody. Hey, Vic, take a walk.
VIC: Where you been keeping yourself, baby?
BLONDE: Do I know you?
VIC: Do you know me? Don't you remember that week in Miami? Ever see  what she looks like in a bikini? Oh, mamma mia.
ZEEMO: When were you in Miami?
BLONDE: I don't know what he's talking about.
VIC: Who's this? Your grandpa?
ZEEMO: Frankie.
FRANKIE: Cicci!
CICCI: Now you've done it.
FRANKIE: Bury him. So long, sucker.
ZEEMO: Frankie, I'm waiting for the money.
FRANKIE: Yes, all right. Right this way.
SISKO: Tonight everyone's a winner.
ZEEMO: What's this? What's going on?
NOG: Piece of cake.
O'BRIEN: Can I go now?
KASIDY: You aren't going anywhere! Don't let him leave.
GUARD: Charlie, over here. Take this gentleman to security.
KASIDY: But I wanted you to handle this.
GUARD: I'm afraid I can't leave my post. Charlie, strip search.
O'BRIEN: Strip search?
GUARD: There, there, it's not worth all that.
KASIDY: I needed that money to buy a gift for my mother.
ZEEMO: Funny way to run a casino.
KIRA: What are you waiting for, Frankie? Why don't you show Mister  Zeemo to the countroom.
ZEEMO: Well you heard the lady.
FRANKIE: I'm telling you, Mister Zeemo, buying this casino was the  smartest move you ever made. We're making money hand over fist.
FRANKIE: I just hope you brought a big enough  briefcase.
ZEEMO: Where's my money?
VIC: Now that's more like it.
ODO: Say goodbye to Frankie Eyes.
KIRA: You can tell Felix that we shut the lid on his jack in the box.
BASHIR: With pleasure.
VIC: Ladies and gentlemen, the bubbly's on me.
BASHIR: Thanks. Vic.
ODO: Hear, hear.
BASHIR: Where've you been?
O'BRIEN: I don't want to talk about it.
VIC: The next time you two fight the battle of the Alamo, count me in.  Coonskin cap and all.
BASHIR: You got it, pallie.
VIC: To the best friends a hologram ever had.
BASHIR: Hear, hear.
O'BRIEN: Cheers.
VIC: I owe you, big time.
BASHIR: Cheers, Vic.
EZRI: Cheers.
VIC: Okay, fellas, let's do it. Captain? You'll join me?
KIRA: What?
