LOOMIS:  Hello?
DAMRON : Have you made your selection?
LOOMIS: Yeah, yeah, it's all set, just like we discussed.
DAMRON : We'll be expecting you.
LOOMIS: And the money, same as last time, right?
DAMRON:  The same. Be careful with the sedative. You nearly killed the last one.
LOOMIS : One hundred milligrams. Don't worry, I'll get it right.
DAMRON: We'll be expecting you.
PROSTITUTE: Looking for a date, honey?
LOOMIS: Maybe with your friend.
PROSTITUTE: You don't know what you're missing.
GEORGIA: Ooo, what can I do for you, sweetheart?
GEORGIA: Hey, I know you from this morning. You brought me the apple juice.
LOOMIS: What?
GEORGIA: At the clinic?
LOOMIS: Oh, yeah. Now I remember. Small world, huh?
GEORGIA: Want me to get in?
LOOMIS: Sure, yeah.
GEORGIA: Bye, girl. See you tomorrow.
GEORGIA: There's a nice place to park  right in the neighbourhood. Turn left at the next light.
LOOMIS: Georgia Tandy, O negative.
GEORGIA: How the hell would you remember that?
GEORGIA: Er, it's another two blocks.
GEORGIA: If that's drugs, I am not interested. What you got in there?
LOOMIS: Come here.
LOOMIS: There you  go. There you go.
LOOMIS: It's okay.  They said they won't hurt you.
DAMRON : Yes?
LOOMIS: Loomis.
LOOMIS: There you go, nice and comfy.
ARCHER:   Good boy. Cheese?
ARCHER: This is  your last piece.
DANIELS: It's okay. How've you been, Jon?
ARCHER: About time you showed up. Our mission's changed quite a bit  since the last time I saw you, but I suppose you're aware of it.
DANIELS: I am.
ARCHER: Maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me. The Xindi  weapon would be a good place to start.
DANIELS: We don't know any more than you do.
ARCHER: I thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping  an eye on the time line. You're from the thirtieth century. Hasn't all  this happened already?
DANIELS: History doesn't mention anything about a conflict between  humans and Xindi.
ARCHER: How could that be?
DANIELS: The events that are taking place are the result of temporal  incursions. They are not supposed to be happening.
ARCHER: But they are happening.
DANIELS: Yes, they are, but the outcome hasn't reached us yet. It takes  a while for changes to ripple through the time line.
ARCHER: The time traveller, the man the Suliban worked for.
DANIELS: What about him?
ARCHER: He's the one who told us about the weapon being built. Should I  believe him?
DANIELS: You have no reason not to.
ARCHER: You said I'm supposed to play some crucial part in history.  Does this have something to do with it?
DANIELS: I wish I could say that it does, but I don't know. I told you,  none of this was supposed to happen.
ARCHER: You're not being very helpful. Why are you here?
DANIELS: We've detected three Xindi where they're not supposed to be.
ARCHER: This Expanse is filled with Xindi.
DANIELS: I'm not talking about the Expanse. I'm talking about Detroit,  Michigan, a hundred and fifty years ago.
ARCHER: Sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait.
T'POL: Come in.
ARCHER: I just had a visit from Daniels. I think all your doubts about  time travel are about to go out the window.
T'POL: Meaning?
ARCHER: Daniels and his team have discovered three Reptilians on Earth  in the early twenty first century. He wants to send us back to find out  what they're doing.
T'POL: Us?
ARCHER: He told me I could bring one person, no more.
T'POL: If Daniels is the time traveller he claims to be, why doesn't he  find our for himself?
ARCHER: It took him a long while to get permission to interact with me.  There are clearances. He said it would take too much time.
T'POL: I would think he would have all the time in the world.
ARCHER: He said the three Xindi travelled to Earth from our century.  They've been there for two months. They're not sight-seeing, T'Pol. We  have to find out what they're up to.
T'POL: How are we supposed to accomplish this?
ARCHER: He wants us to meet him in the Command Centre at oh eight  hundred tomorrow.  Come on, boy. Check the database. Find  something to wear that won't stand out in 2004.
TUCKER:  Last time Daniels sent you to another century you had one hell of a  time getting back.
ARCHER: He gave me this, said he'd return us whenever we signalled him.
ARCHER: These are temporal tags. We can  use them to bring back anything that doesn't belong there.
TUCKER: If anyone asks where you went, what should I tell them? With  two shuttlepods in the bay it'll be hard to explain.
ARCHER: I'm sure you'll think of something. Try to stay out of trouble.
TUCKER: You too.
ARCHER: Here's the duty roster.
T'POL:  We just travelled ninety light years back to Earth.
ARCHER: And a hundred and fifty years into the past.
T'POL: Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced.
ARCHER: You will be. Come on.
ARCHER: This one has a motion activated security system. This  one too.
ARCHER: We're in.
T'POL: This apparatus. It appears to have been designed to incapacitate  the vehicle.
RADIO: Sunday, the Tri-state Speedway, an all-star line-up of all your  favourite monster mayhem.
T'POL:  Have you ever operated a vehicle from this period?
ARC HER: I can pilot a starship. R N D 2 3 4.
T'POL: I suggest you begin with two.
ARCHER: Foot controls.
T'POL: I don't believe you've activated your external lighting.
ARCHER: What year is that map from?
T'POL: 2002. It was the closest I could find in the  Starfleet database.
ARCHER: The layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years.
T'POL: Turn starboard on twenty fourth street.
ARCHER: If that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres, how  far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city?
T'POL: I have created a search grid that requires a journey of  approximately eighty kilometres, but it's probably we'll find them  before we complete it.
T'POL: What's that icon?
ARCHER: It's a gasoline pump. We need to get fuel.
T'POL: Where?
ARCHER: Where isn't the problem. We're going to need money. US  currency.
T'POL: That's going to be difficult at this time of night.
ARCHER: Not necessarily.
ARCHER: People used to go to jail for this.
T'POL: We'll return what we don't use.
STRODE: Yeah?
LOOMIS: Are you Vaughan Strode?
STRODE: Who are you?
LOOMIS: I'm from the blood bank. We had a screw-up this afternoon. We  gave you the wrong papers to sign.
STRODE: I'm not giving the money back.
LOOMIS: No, no, no, they don't want the money back. In fact. they're  going to pay you again. Twenty five bucks. They just need you to sign  the right papers.
STRODE: You bring them?
LOOMIS: No, they wouldn't let me. You've got to do it in front of the  supervisor. You know, the fat broad that paid you. They sent me to  drive you down.
STRODE: It's eleven o'clock at night.
LOOMIS: Yeah, I know. They want to send your blood work out first thing  in the morning and they can't do it without the right paperwork. You  want the twenty five bucks or not?
STRODE: This going to  take long? I don't want to miss Conan.
T'POL:  Were they aware at this time that Earth's supply of fossil fuel was  nearing depletion?
ARCHER: They had been for thirty years, but it wasn't until 2061 that  they finally
T'POL: One kilometre, straight ahead.
T'POL: Second structure from the left. Three Xindi biosigns.
ARCHER: Any humans?
T'POL: Five, in another part of the building.
ARCHER: This doesn't look very residential. Set your phase pistol to  kill. When the Reptilians boarded Enterprise, stun had no effect. See  what you can find out. I'll look over there.
T'POL: Go ahead.
ARCHER: There's a neutronic power source coming from the  first floor.
T'POL: I've found a gate with an electric locking mechanism. We  shouldn't have a problem. Do you see the vehicle?
ARCHER: I see it.
DAMRON : Yes?
LOOMIS: Loomis.
DAMRON: Did you disinfect your hands?
LOOMIS: I insert IVs all day, I told you that. If there are any  infections here it won't be because of me. You forget something?
DAMRON: We've decided to compensate you for the final three patients in  one payment.
LOOMIS: Well, that's not what we agreed. You said I'd get paid for each  one.
DAMRON: Bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated.
LOOMIS: We should wait a while, a few more days at least. There was  something on the news. Cops are starting to get some complaints that  people have gone missing.
DAMRON: We can't wait a few more days. We need the last two.
LOOMIS: Look, as soon as they figure out that all these people here  have been to the clinic, it won't take a rocket scientist to point the  finger at me.
DAMRON: Then I suggest you finish your work quickly.
LOOMIS: Look, I don't know what you guys are up to, and I don't want to  know. It's not my business. But the cops don't take kindly to people  who help terrorists. I gotta be real careful.
DAMRON: We will double your fee for the final three, but the last two  must be here by tomorrow.
LOOMIS: Double? Tomorrow? Yeah, all right. I'll have them here by  tomorrow.
ARCHER: Here he comes.
LOOMIS: Ninth floor.  Two hundred and eighty pounds.   William Myers, second floor.
ARCHER: And the man in the wheelchair. Why were you bringing him to an  abandoned factory in the middle of the night?
LOOMIS: I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
T'POL: What's this?
LOOMIS: Oh, I took that from the clinic. I work at the blood bank on  Porter Street. Check with them, they'll tell you. I've been there for  over a year.
ARCHER: Why would you take it?
LOOMIS: Make a few extra bucks. There's plenty of people on the street  looking for that stuff.
T'POL: Really. Why would anyone on the street be interested in  acquiring methohexitol?
ARCHER: You make it a habit of climbing out your window when someone  knocks on the door?
LOOMIS: I don't like cops.
ARCHER: Tell us about your friends on Carpenter Street.
LOOMIS: I've never been to Carpenter Street.
ARCHER: You were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair. Now  tell me who's inside that factory.
LOOMIS: I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. I think  it's time you find me a lawyer.
ARCHER: Untie him.
LOOMIS: You heard him. Untie me.
LOOMIS: That's better.
ARCHER: I didn't feel right doing that with you tied up. Carpenter  Street.
LOOMIS: You're not allowed to hit me.
ARCHER: Untie him again.
LOOMIS: No, no, no, no, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute, I  don't know who he is, I swear to God. A doctor, maybe. Says he's  working on a vaccine, experimental. He doesn't have approval or  something like that so he needed me to bring him people.
T'POL: Does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research is  being conducted in an abandoned factory?
LOOMIS: I thought about that. Just tonight, I thought maybe he's some  kind of terrorist. But I swear if I knew that for a fact I never would  have agreed to help him.
T'POL: In one individual we've managed to find the worst qualities of  this era. Greed, violence, moral corruption.
LOOMIS: But he said he wasn't going to hurt anybody. I just saw them an  hour ago. They're all okay.
ARCHER: How many?
LOOMIS: Five. No, no, six. The wheelchair guy was number six.
ARCHER: How did this doctor find you.
LOOMIS: I told you, I work at the blood bank. He wanted someone from  every blood type. Eight blood types, eight people. He figured I had  access to that kind of information.
T'POL: Did he also figure that you'd have no  compunctions about abducting people?
ARCHER: What's he paying you?
LOOMIS: Five thousand apiece, double for the last three.
T'POL: Is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century?
LOOMIS: I told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them.
ARCHER: What does he look like?
LOOMIS: He only calls me on the phone. I saw him a couple of times, but  he stays in the shadows. You know, he's kind of tall, that's all I can  tell you. Why don't you let me go. I swear to you, I will never do it  again.
ARCHER: You are going to do it again. That is, if you have any hope of  staying out of prison.
LOOMIS: What are you talking about?
ARCHER: These two files, AB positive and B negative, they're the final  two?
LOOMIS: Yeah.
ARCHER: Well, then you're looking at your next victim, a healthy male  with B negative blood.
LOOMIS:  If you think you're going to be in  there a long time, we should get something to eat first.
T'POL: Be quiet.
LOOMIS: Come on, I'm not talking about anything fancy. A burger, a  taco? There's a drive-through less than a mile from here. Cops have to  eat, don't they? What is the matter with you two? I'll pay.
T'POL: I told you to be quiet.
ARCHER: What side of the street is it on?
WOMAN : Welcome to Burgerland. How may I serve you, sir?
LOOMIS: I'll have the Double Superbeef, no lettuce.
ARCHER: One Double Superbeef without lettuce, please.
WOMAN : You can make that a triple for only forty cents extra.
LOOMIS: Do it.
ARCHER: A double will be fine.
WOMAN : Would you like to make that a combo?
LOOMIS: Yeah, fries and a medium root beer.
WOMAN : Will there be anything else today?
ARCHER: A hamburger, ketchup only.
WOMAN : You can make that a double for only forty cents extra.
ARCHER: No, thank you.
WOMAN : Would you like to make that a combo?
ARCHER: No, no combo.
WOMAN : Will there be anything else today?
T'POL: Does the Fiesta Salad contain animal products?
WOMAN : No, but we can add three strips of bacon for only seventy  five cents more.
T'POL: Nothing for me, thank you.
ARCHER: You're sure?
T'POL: Quite.
LOOMIS: You guys don't mind, do  you? I'm starving. You know, it'd make it a lot easier if you'd untie  my hands. It's not like I'm going anywhere.
ARCHER: Do the best you can.
LOOMIS: Uh oh, I told you. Let  me get that for you. Oh boy.
LOOMIS: You're a veggie, I forgot. Why don't you take a fry,  they're probably okay. Have it your way.
LOOMIS: They'll  come in to take fresh blood samples every hour. They re-administer the  sedative every six hours. I recommend you do whatever you're going to  do before then.
LOOMIS: Number seven.
DAMRON: Which one is it?
LOOMIS: B, B negative. You'll have AB positive by tomorrow night, I  swear.
DAMRON: Make certain I do.
T'POL:  Engage the engine and proceed to  the second location.
LOOMIS: Nice ray gun. Am I supposed to believe that thing's for real?
T'POL: Drive.
LOOMIS: Ten grand a piece for the last three and I'm not going to see a  penny of it.
T'POL: Don't speak until we're out of visual range.
REPTILIAN:  Fifteen millilitres from the new  arrival.
LOOMIS:  You catch these guys and I get immunity, right. We're not talking about  copping to a lesser charge.
T'POL: When my associate returns we'll discuss the details.
LOOMIS: Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, okay? If your associate  doesn't catch them, they're going to come looking for me, okay? You two  have to keep your word.
T'POL: You've been abducting people for money and you're questioning  our honesty?
T'POL: Sit back.
LOOMIS: Relax, just getting a smoke.
T'POL: What are you doing?
LOOMIS: I don't know about you, honey, but I'm a little tense. know  what I mean?
T'POL: Extinguish that now!
LOOMIS: If you want some air, open your window.
T'POL: Now.
T'POL: Stay exactly where you are.
T'POL: T'Pol.
ARCHER : They brought a bio-reactor with them. They're synthesising  some kind of viral agent.
ARCHER:  Rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon. This could be it.
T'POL:  Why would they travel back through time?
ARCHER : Daniels said they might be hiding from someone.
ARCHER:  The past seems like a pretty good place to hide.
ARCHER  : We've got to keep them from getting it back to our time.
T'POL: Are you in a position to disable all three of them?
ARCHER:  I don't know. I was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor,  but I could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city.
T'POL:  They must have some kind of temporal beacon. If you can destroy it,  they'll have no way of getting back.
ARCHER:  I've got to find it first.
T'POL:  Modify your scanner to a delta band frequency. That should help you  locate the signal from the temporal beacon.
ARCHER:  They've gone out the west door. They could  be headed for the street. They have the virus.
ARCHER:  T'Pol.
T'POL : Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: They're in the west alley way north of the main
ARCHER  : Building. I could use some help.
T'POL: Acknowledged.
T'POL: Drive.
LOOMIS:  Trouble?
T'POL: Drive.
T'POL: Pull over and stop here.
LOOMIS: They give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it do  you.
T'POL: Lower your window.
LOOMIS:  I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work.
T'POL: Be quiet. They're coming.
T'POL: Stop!
ARCHER: Come on.
ARCHER: He's trying to release the toxin.
T'POL: We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century.  Perhaps he has no other choice.
ARCHER: If he's trying to destroy humanity, he's not going to be able  to do it with that. They only modified the virus for six blood types.
T'POL: If they can infect three quarters of Earth's population, it's  unlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future.
ARCHER: Let's hope he can't see in the dark. Keep laying down fire.
ARCHER: Don't move a muscle. Drop it. Why a second weapon? Where were  you going to take it?
DAMRON: We won't allow you to destroy us. Your species is doomed.
ARCHER: Let's go.
TUCKER:  Problem, sir?
ARCHER: It's done.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
REED : Go ahead.
ARCHER: Get a team down to the Command centre on the double.
REED : Aye sir.
ARCHER:  Wait here for Malcolm. Have everything brought to  Cargo Bay two. I've got to get this to Phlox.
TUCKER: What's going on?
T'POL: Come with me.
OFFICER 1: Get out of the car.
OFFICER 2: He's on something.
OFFICER 1: Get out of the car.
OFFICER 1: Keep your  hands where we can see them.
OFFICER 2: Come on. Come on.
LOOMIS: What's going on?
LOOMIS: Hey, hey,  hey, I didn't do anything.
OFFICER 1: We got a tip says you did.
OFFICER 2: You're just lucky all six of them are still alive.
LOOMIS: Those two cops who came to my place, they offered me a deal.  That's the only reason I helped them.
OFFICER 1: I don't know what you're talking about. Get him out of here.
LOOMIS: Those creature, the lizard people,  they're around here somewhere. You've got to find them.
OFFICER 2: No problem, we'll get right on that.
LOOMIS: Be careful, be careful. They've got ray guns.
OFFICER 2: Ray guns. Got it.
OFFICER 2:Watch your  head.
