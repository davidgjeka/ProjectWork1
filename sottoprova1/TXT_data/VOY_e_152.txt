TORRES:  Feels heavy. Baby's first tricorder?
TUVOK: Not exactly.
TORRES: Thank you, I'm sure she'll  love it. What is it?
TUVOK: A pleenok. Vulcans use them to train their infants in primary  logic.
PARIS: Never too early to train those synapses, eh, Tuvok? Let me see that.  I love a good puzzle.
NEELIX: This one's from Mister Kim.
TORRES: Starfleet diapers.
KIM: Standard issue.
PARIS: Well, we know who to call if there's a containment breach.
JANEWAY: Now that your Borg implants have been removed, you might think  about having children of your own one day.
SEVEN: One day. I have been considering some less radical changes in my  personal life.
JANEWAY: Such as?
SEVEN: I realise I don't have a rank, but I would like to request a  uniform.
JANEWAY: Consider it done. The Doctor tells me you don't need to  regenerate any more. I can arrange some quarters for you, unless you  enjoy curling up in the Cargo Bay.
SEVEN: A bed would be more comfortable. Since I arrived on Voyager,  your guidance has been invaluable. Thank you, Captain.
JANEWAY: All I did was chart the course. You're the one who made the  journey.
CHAKOTAY: Seven, it's traditional for everyone to share their best  wishes for the baby. I thought you might like to start.
SEVEN: To the newest member of our crew. May all her desires be  fulfilled except for one, so she'll always have something to strive  for.
JANEWAY: Very good.
ALL: Hear, hear.
SEVEN: And may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother.
KIM: I'll drink to that.
PARIS:  That was strange.
CHAKOTAY: Care to explain?
PARIS: I wish I could. Long range sensors picked up an energy  discharge, but now it's gone. There. There's another one.
TUVOK: They're occurring approximately five point nine light years  ahead.
CHAKOTAY: Source?
TUVOK: We're too far away to get a clear reading.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine.
SEVEN:  Go ahead.
JANEWAY : Report to the Astrometrics lab.
SEVEN: Acknowledged. Computer, end programme.
SEVEN: I  wasn't able to find the cause of the discharges, but the region ahead  contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris.
TUVOK: Vessels?
SEVEN: Not within range. But I'll have more data once we move closer.
JANEWAY: I see no reason to alter course. Keep an eye on your sensors.
SEVEN: Yes, Captain.
JANEWAY: Now, on to more pressing matters. Does B'Elanna suspect  anything?
PARIS: Not a clue.
JANEWAY: Good. Mess hall, fourteen hundred hours, be on time. I don't  want to spoil the surprise. I expect both of you to show up.
SEVEN: I'll be busy here.
PARIS: What's wrong, Seven? No baby showers in the Collective?
JANEWAY: I'm sure you can spare a few minutes.
TUVOK: If it's any consolation, I share your discomfort with social  gatherings.
SEVEN: They seem to occur with alarming frequency.
TUVOK: Mister Neelix would argue that they improve morale.
SEVEN: I have been looking for ways to improve my social skills.  Perhaps I'll attend.
NEELIX:  Well, it certainly is efficient. No clutter, plenty of room to move  around. But it's a little impersonal, don't you think?
SEVEN: Explain.
NEELIX: Well, these are your quarters, Seven. They should reflect your  individuality. How about a table and a couple of chairs? Give yourself  a place to work, entertain guests. Try to add a little colour.  Photographs, artwork, knick-knacks.
SEVEN: Knick-knacks?
NEELIX: Little things, like the wood carvings in Ensign Kim's quarters.
SEVEN: I've never been to Ensign Kim's quarters. But I suppose I could  replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room.
NEELIX: That's a start. Some people like to display pictures of family  and friends.
SEVEN: There's a photograph of my parents in the ship's database. I'll  make a copy and place it in a frame.
NEELIX: Good, good.
SEVEN: A multispectral star chart might enhance this bulkhead.
NEELIX: Or a painting.
SEVEN: A painting of a star chart.
NEELIX: I was thinking of something more abstract, more artistic.  Drapes. Nothing livens up a room like good window dressing. Not to  mention the added privacy.
SEVEN: Privacy? We're in space.
NEELIX: You never know when we'll be docking at a crowded space  port. But we'll have to make sure that they match the carpet. I'm  thinking of a Talaxian mosaic. Tulaberry blue stripes with an orange  inlay.
SEVEN: I appreciate your aesthetic insights, but I believe I can  proceed on my own.
SEVEN: Enter.
CHAKOTAY: Am I interrupting?
SEVEN: Please come in.
CHAKOTAY: Love what you've done with the place.
SEVEN: We're in the process of decorating.
CHAKOTAY: Maybe this will help. Consider it a housewarming gift.
NEELIX: It's beautiful. What is it?
SEVEN: A dream catcher. According to Native American mythology, it wards  off nightmares.
CHAKOTAY: I'm impressed.
SEVEN: I've familiarised myself with your culture.
CHAKOTAY: Now that you'll be sleeping instead of regenerating, I  thought it might come in handy.
SEVEN: I'm sure it will. Thank you.
NEELIX: I'll let you two find a place to hang that, but it would look  perfect right above the bed. Pleasant dreams.
SEVEN: It was thoughtful of you to stop by.
CHAKOTAY: On move in day? I wouldn't miss it.
SEVEN: I suppose this makes you my inaugural guest. I'd be a negligent  host if I didn't offer you a beverage. Tea?
CHAKOTAY: That might be difficult. No replicator.
SEVEN: Another flaw in the decor.
CHAKOTAY: I'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow.
SEVEN: I'd appreciate that, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay. We're off duty. We can drop the formalities.
SEVEN: Yes, sir.
CHAKOTAY: I enjoyed your toast today. You've come a long way. I hope to  see more.
SEVEN: You will.
CHAKOTAY: Good night.
SEVEN: Chakotay. As you might know I've taken an interest in culinary  science. I'm preparing a meal tomorrow night, and I thought perhaps you  could attend to evaluate my work.
CHAKOTAY: I'd be happy to.
SEVEN: Nineteen hundred hours?
CHAKOTAY: I'll bring the wine and the furniture.
SEVEN: Then you accept?
CHAKOTAY: It's a date.
EMH:   Rock-a-bye baby, in the space dock. When the core blows, the  shuttle will rock. When the hull breaks, the shuttle will fall. And  down will come baby, shuttle and all.
SEVEN: Are you trying to soothe the infant, or traumatise her?
EMH: The lyrics are rather grim, but it's the melody they respond to. I  recorded twenty nine in all, including a couple of Klingon lullabies.  My favourite is 'quong vaj Ocht. Sleep, little warrior. I could tell by  the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression.
SEVEN: No doubt.
EMH: I wish you'd been there. It was a lovely shower. Tom and B'Elanna  were disappointed that you didn't attend.
SEVEN: I was occupied.
EMH: Are you experiencing any shoulder pain?
SEVEN: Yes.
EMH: Hmm. Your biradial clamp is out of alignment by point three  microns. I'm afraid it will have to be repaired.
SEVEN: Can't you simply extract the component?
EMH: Not if you want to keep using that arm. I know it's an  inconvenience, but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic  systems, they'll have to be maintained. It's a minor procedure. We might  as well take care of it now.
SEVEN: I prefer to wait.
EMH: We'll be done in an hour.
SEVEN: I have research to complete.
EMH: Oh. I suppose we can put it off until next week's physical. I also  noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by twelve percent. Have  you missed any regeneration cycles?
SEVEN: Last night.
EMH: Don't tell me. More research? This must be some project. Mind if I  ask what you're working on?
SEVEN: It's complicated.
EMH: How do you mean?
SEVEN: My personal life is none of your concern.
EMH: I wasn't aware you had a personal life.
JANEWAY:  Report.
PARIS: It was an energy discharge, two hundred thousand kilometres  starboard.
TUVOK: It produced a level nine shockwave.
CHAKOTAY: Some kind of weapon?
TUVOK: Possibly.
PARIS: Another one, five million kilometres to port.
TUVOK: A shockwave is approaching.
JANEWAY: Full power to the shields.
KIM: Our warp field's destabilising.
TUVOK: I'm detecting another. Distance, fifty thousand kilometres.
JANEWAY: Turn our bow into the wavefront. It'll minimise the damage.
PARIS: Sorry, Captain. There wasn't enough time.
KIM: We've lost warp drive.
TUVOK: I'm reading another. Distance, twenty six million kilometres.  Too far to pose a threat.
CHAKOTAY: If they are weapons, they don't seem to be directed at us.
JANEWAY: Or whoever's firing them is a lousy shot.
SEVEN:  Astrometric sensors recorded the explosions. I believe it's a  long range subspace warhead. The debris in this region suggests that  dozens have been fired in the last several weeks.
TUVOK: The warhead destroyed something. What was it?
SEVEN: It appeared to be an unmanned probe.
JANEWAY: This is all very intriguing, but I'd just as soon get out of  here before we cross paths with another one of these things. Where do  we stand on repairs?
TUVOK: Subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to  create a stable warp field. Lieutenant Torres estimates forty eight  hours.
JANEWAY: Can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge  from subspace?
SEVEN: I believe so. The weapons create minor gravimetric distortions  as they approach the subspace barrier. But I need to recalibrate my  sensors to isolate the effect.
JANEWAY: Do it. Even a few seconds' warning would help us.
SEVEN: Yes, Captain.
SEVEN:  Your duty shift doesn't begin for two hours.
ICHEB: The Doctor sent me to relieve you early. He wants you to spend  more time regenerating.
SEVEN: I see he's enlisted an ally.
ICHEB: Don't kill the messenger.Â Sophocles, Oedipus Rex. I've been  studying Earth literature as a part of my Academy training.
SEVEN: Continue these scans of the subspace barrier. Look for any  gravimetric distortions.
TORRES:  Run another diagnostic on the injector ports. Make sure they're  aligned.
KIM: They're aligned, I checked.
TORRES: Check again. Come to join the party? We're trying to cold start  the warp core for the fifteenth time.
SEVEN: Perhaps this will enhance your day. It's a belated gift for your  baby shower. I apologise for my absence.
TORRES: Oh.
SEVEN: Proceed.
SEVEN: They're lined  with biothermal insulation. Your infant's feet will be protected even  if the external temperature drops below minus forty degrees Celsius.
TORRES: Well, they're certainly unique. Thank you.
SEVEN: You're welcome. I wish to ask you a personal question.
TORRES: Shoot.
SEVEN: You have an appealing coiffure. What is your grooming regimen?
TORRES: You're asking me what I do with my hair?
SEVEN: Yes.
TORRES: Um, well, nothing too elaborate. Sonic shower, a little engine  grease. Thinking about a new look?
SEVEN: Perhaps. I'll keep you apprised, if you'd like.
TORRES: Please do.
TORRES: Was that Seven of Nine?
KIM: There must be an alien intruder on board.
SEVEN:  Computer, make the following modifications to holodeck file Seven of  Nine alpha three, personal quarters.
COMPUTER: Modifications complete.
SEVEN: Begin programme.
SEVEN: I'm surprised your Starfleet training didn't include cork  extraction.
SEVEN: Unless you brought a phaser.
SEVEN: Assist me. Slice these vegetables transversally in five  millimetre increments.
SEVEN: Our appetizer is braised leeks. Primary course, rack of lamb  with wild rice.
SEVEN: Dessert will be a surprise.
SEVEN: Does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste?
SEVEN: I concur. More salt.
SEVEN: Chopin. I've discovered that classical music has intriguing  mathematical properties.
SEVEN: The Doctor's been giving me piano lessons.
SEVEN: I require more practice.
SEVEN: Your  technique is flawed.
SEVEN: Use your left hand to guide the food. Observe closely. Pay  attention to the vegetable.
SEVEN: It wasn't a smile. It was a smirk.
SEVEN: Remain still.
SEVEN: You have an intriguing facial structure.
SEVEN: I require more practice.
SEVEN: Nothing.
EMH: I wasn't aware you had a personal life.
CHAKOTAY  : Chakotay to Seven of Nine.
CHAKOTAY : Chakotay to Seven, respond.
SEVEN: Go ahead.
CHAKOTAY : Report to Astrometrics. We've found something.
SEVEN: Yes, Commander.
CHAKOTAY:  Good morning.
SEVEN: You've found something?
CHAKOTAY: At first, we thought it was another one of the probes. Then  Icheb picked up an automated transmission. It's a warning beacon.
VOICE : You have entered subspace munitions range four three four.  Evacuate immediately.
ICHEB: Apparently, this entire region is an alien testing ground.
CHAKOTAY: We've been sending out emergency hails, but so far no  response. Whoever's conducting these tests could be dozens of light  years away. Any progress detecting their warheads?
SEVEN: Not yet.
CHAKOTAY: You seem a little distracted.
SEVEN: I'm fine.
CHAKOTAY: It's not like you to be late for a duty shift. Rough night?
SEVEN: Not at all.
CHAKOTAY: I'll be on the bridge if you find anything.
ICHEB: Better late than never. Titus Livius, A History of Rome.
SEVEN: You're relieved. Get some rest.
SEVEN: You approve?
SEVEN: The Doctor's an efficient instructor.
SEVEN: The Doctor did suggest that I accompany him during his next  operatic performance. Your turn.
SEVEN: You want me to stop?
SEVEN: I don't understand.
SEVEN: My tempo is erratic.
SEVEN: Frustration, anxiety.
SEVEN: I can't.
TUVOK:  Eight hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow.
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine.
SEVEN : Go ahead, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: We need those sensor calibrations.
SEVEN:  I'll need a moment to return to my station.
CHAKOTAY:  That would be a good idea.
PARIS: Hull fracture, deck twelve.
JANEWAY: Seven of Nine, report.
SEVEN : Stand by, Captain.
SEVEN:  Lieutenant Paris, isolate subspace band omicron theta.
PARIS:  Acknowledged.
SEVEN : Direct your sensors to
SEVEN: Coordinates one seven eight mark two six.
PARIS:  Nothing there.
SEVEN:  Correction, one seven eight mark three six.
PARIS: I  can see them. Two warheads are about to emerge. Adjusting course.
JANEWAY: Full power to the forward shields.
PARIS: Impact in five, four, three, two.
PARIS: Shields are holding.
JANEWAY: Why wasn't Seven at her post?
CHAKOTAY: Good question. Maybe you should ask her.
JANEWAY:  It was your responsibility to locate those warheads.
SEVEN: I succeeded.
JANEWAY: Not before we took heavy damage. You told Chakotay you'd have  those sensor calibrations hours ago.
SEVEN: The work took longer than I anticipated.
JANEWAY: It might've gone faster if you'd stayed at your post, as you  were ordered to do.
SEVEN: I didn't realise I was confined to the Astrometrics lab.
JANEWAY: You were on duty. This isn't the first time you've left your  station over the past few days. Holodeck two? You've logged a lot of  time in there. Mind if I ask why? Well, it must be something important,  Seven. Forty nine hours in six days.
SEVEN: I was running a simulation.
JANEWAY: Of what?
SEVEN: A new gravimetric array I've been developing. I wanted to  perfect the design before I brought it to you.
JANEWAY: I appreciate your efforts to improve our systems, but I can't  have you dividing your time right now. When the ship's on alert I  expect you to perform your duties. If you need to leave your post,  inform Commander Chakotay. Understood?
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. I apologise for my lapse in judgment.
JANEWAY: We all make mistakes, Seven. I've even been known to make a  few myself. It sounds intriguing, your new gravimetric array. When this  crisis is over I'd be happy to take a look. Maybe I can lend a hand.
ICHEB:  I've analysed the sensor data from that last barrage. I've refined your  detection method. We'll be able to see the weapons ten point three  seconds earlier.
SEVEN: The Captain will be pleased.
ICHEB: Have I offended you?
SEVEN: No. You've done nothing wrong. I was negligent in my duties. As  a result, Voyager was nearly destroyed. I was hoping you could provide  a quotation to help alleviate my guilt.
ICHEB: I, I can't think of one, but I'd be happy to search the database.
SEVEN: That won't be necessary. Stay here until I return.
ICHEB: Where are you going?
SEVEN: To correct an error.
SEVEN:  Computer, activate Chakotay simulation. 
SEVEN: Come in.
SEVEN: I called you here to thank you.
SEVEN: The past few days have been memorable.
SEVEN: In a manner of speaking, yes.
SEVEN: Our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on  Voyager.
SEVEN: I'm sorry, Commander.
SEVEN: No, I'm trying to correct one.
SEVEN: Your analogy is flawed.
SEVEN: It's irrelevant.
SEVEN:Â I must return to my station.
SEVEN: This ship needs me.
SEVEN: I can't function this way.
SEVEN: Stop!
SEVEN:Â Sickbay, medical emergency.
EMH:  Seven? Computer, locate Seven of Nine.
COMPUTER: Seven of Nine is in Holodeck two.
EMH:Â What happened?
EMH: Her cortical node is shutting down. She's going into neural shock.  And what happened to her facial implants?
EMH: Computer, end programme.
SEVEN:  Commander?
EMH: If you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's offline  at the moment. Your cortical node began to shut down. Fortunately, I  managed to stabilise it before there was any permanent damage.
SEVEN: It was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago.
EMH: I'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array, but  it might help if I knew what you were doing before you collapsed. Did  you suffer a physical injury of some kind?
SEVEN: No.
EMH: Were you exposed to any unusual radiation?
SEVEN: No.
EMH: What exactly were you doing in there?
SEVEN: Research.
EMH: That simulation of Commander Chakotay mentioned that the two of  you were having an argument. Was that part of your research? I couldn't  help but notice that you'd created some quarters for yourself. A new  dress, dinner for two.
SEVEN: I trust you'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality.
EMH: Of course.
SEVEN: I've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of  my humanity.
EMH: Such as?
SEVEN: Social activities, friendships with the crew, intimate  relations.
EMH: I take it our First Officer is your romantic interest.
SEVEN: Commander Chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice. He has  many admirable qualities.
EMH: So he does. What prompted all this?
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero. I've been trying to recreate some of the  experiences I had there. Ever since it was destroyed, my life has  seemed incomplete. I wanted to feel those emotions again.
EMH: Well, this is encouraging. You might be ready to start forming  deeper relationships. I'm proud of you, Seven.
SEVEN: Your pride is misplaced. I intend to delete the programmes.
EMH: Why?
SEVEN: I can no longer perform my duties efficiently. My personal life  has become a distraction.
EMH: It's supposed to be a distraction. You simply have to find the  right balance between work and recreation.
SEVEN: Inform me when you finish the diagnostic.
EMH: Seven. For what it's worth, you have excellent taste. Your  quarters. They suited you.
KIM:  Antimatter flow stable, injector ports aligned. That should do it.
TORRES: Torres to the bridge. Looks like we've got warp drive back.
JANEWAY:  Well done. Tom.
PARIS: With pleasure.
PARIS: I'm detecting another subspace warhead.
JANEWAY: Range?
PARIS: Twelve million kilometres, closing from astern.
CHAKOTAY: Red alert. Where's the target probe?
PARIS: It's on a totally different trajectory.
TUVOK: When we engaged the engines, the warhead must have diverted from  its target and locked onto our warp signature.
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres.
PARIS: It's matching our course. Eight million kilometres.
JANEWAY: Can you get a weapon's lock?
TUVOK: Affirmative.
JANEWAY: Photon torpedoes, full spread.
TUVOK: Our torpedoes have been neutralised.
PARIS: Five million kilometres.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine.
SEVEN : Here, Captain.
JANEWAY: Can you get me anything on
JANEWAY  : The warhead's internal circuitry?
SEVEN: Stand by. I have it.
JANEWAY : What can you tell me about the detonator?
SEVEN: The weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry.
JANEWAY : What's the activation frequency?
SEVEN: Four point eight four gigahertz.
TUVOK: I  may be able to disarm it with an anti-resonance pulse.
JANEWAY: Do it.
PARIS: Two million kilometres.
TUVOK: Initiating the pulse.
JANEWAY: Seven, status?
SEVEN:  The warhead's rotating its activation frequency. It's still armed.
PARIS:  One million kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: Can you compensate?
TUVOK: Negative.
SEVEN : Captain, I believe I can disarm
SEVEN: The warhead.
JANEWAY : How?
SEVEN: By extracting the detonator with our transporter.
JANEWAY:  At this velocity? The device is too small. You'd never get a lock.
SEVEN : I can use the sub
SEVEN: Micron imager to focus our targeting scanners. Please give me  transporter control.
PARIS:  Eight hundred thousand.
JANEWAY: All right, Seven, it's up you.
SEVEN: I  have a lock. Energising. The detonator's protected by tritanium  shielding. I can penetrate it, but not at this distance. We'll have to  wait until it's closer.
PARIS:  Five hundred thousand.
JANEWAY: Status.
SEVEN : Not yet, Captain.
PARIS: Four
PARIS  : Three, two. Brace for impact!
SEVEN:  Doctor. You've come to deliver unpleasant news.
EMH: Is it that obvious? I've completed my diagnostic. What you  experienced was no malfunction. Your cortical node was designed to shut  down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of  emotional stimulation.
SEVEN: Clarify.
EMH: It appears to be a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who  start to regain their emotions. Knowing the Borg, it makes perfect  sense. Finding one's heart is the surest road to individuality.
SEVEN: I'm no longer linked to the hive mind.
EMH: The technology's built into your node. It simply remained dormant,  until now.
SEVEN: Can you repair me?
EMH: Possibly. I've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the  micro-circuitry. I won't lie to you, Seven. It would entail multiple  surgeries, and the recovery might be difficult. But I believe we could  eventually succeed. I'll prepare the surgical bay. We can begin  tomorrow morning.
SEVEN: No.
EMH: Without the procedure, you won't be able to continue your  simulations.
SEVEN: I've experienced enough humanity for the time being. They were  only holographic fantasies, Doctor. An inefficient use of my time.
EMH: You don't really believe that.
SEVEN: The fail-safe device will insure that I'm no longer distracted.
EMH: That's the Borg talking, not you. As your physician. As your  friend, I'm asking you to let me proceed.
SEVEN: I need to regenerate.
EMH: Seven.
SEVEN: Goodnight, Doctor.
CHAKOTAY:  Where's the fire?
SEVEN: Fire?
CHAKOTAY: You seem to be in a hurry.
SEVEN: I have to finish my report on the subspace warheads.
CHAKOTAY: The ship's out of danger, thanks to you. You've earned a  break. Why don't you join me in the mess hall. Neelix is going to give  a cooking lesson. Talaxian tenderloin in ten minutes.
SEVEN: I'm no longer interested in cooking.
CHAKOTAY: Then come for the company. B'Elanna's going to be there,  Tuvok even promised to show up. It'll be fun.
SEVEN: I appreciate your offer. Another time perhaps.
CHAKOTAY: You know, you should try socialising with the crew a little  more. It might do you some good.
