ARCHER: Come here.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
CREWMAN: Commander?
TUCKER: This can't be right. Did you run a diagnostic?
CREWMAN: Twice.
TUCKER: Let's check those relays.
T'POL : Captain to the Bridge.
T'POL:  We're getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship.
TRAVIS: The warp field's fluctuating.
ARCHER : Bridge to Engineering. Report.
TUCKER: I don't get it, Captain. Half the plasma relays have reversed  polarity.
ARCHER : Shut down the reactor.
TUCKER: I'm trying, but it's not cooperating.
TRAVIS:  We're losing main power.
TUCKER:  Now.
REED:  I've restored emergency power, but of our primary systems are still  offline, including weapons.
ARCHER: Trip, what's your status?
TUCKER:  We've got a hell of a mess down here, Captain. It's going to be a while  before I can even figure out what just happened.
ARCHER : Keep me posted.
TRAVIS:  Sir, I'm picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port.
ARCHER: What's their heading?
TRAVIS: Looks like they're holding position, or they could be adrift.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: Our transceiver's offline.
ARCHER: What's our best speed?
TRAVIS: One quarter impulse.
ARCHER: Set a course.
ARCHER: Biosigns?
T'POL: None, and there's no atmosphere aboard. Artificial gravity's  down as well.
ARCHER: Any sign of what happened to them?
REED: No, sir.
ARCHER: Have you spent much time in gravity boots, Corporal?
MCKENZIE: I did a six week tour on Jupiter Station. The grav-plating  went down a few times.
KEMPER: Only in simulation, sir.
HAWKINS: Same here, Captain.
ARCHER: This is an alien ship we're boarding. We could run into  magnetic variances. Watch your step.
ALL: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: We're looking for anything that could tell us what happened to  them.
REED: And don't forget, just because sensors didn't pick up any  biosigns doesn't mean you won't encounter anyone.
ARCHER: Set weapons to stun.
MCKENZIE: Aye sir.
REED:Â Weapons fire.
KEMPER: Captain?  No  external injuries.
ARCHER: Let's find the Bridge.
ARCHER:  Try to access that station. Download what you can.
ARCHER:  We counted seventeen bodies. Most of them died when their life support  ran out. The others were killed by particle weapons. What's our status?
T'POL: Ensign Sato managed to bring the transceiver online, but other  than that.
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS : Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: Resume our previous course, one quarter impulse.
TRAVIS : Understood.
T'POL: It might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into  the Expanse. If we encounter any more anomalies
ARCHER: Those people have been dead for less than two days. Whoever  attacked them could still be nearby. We'll have to make repairs on the  move. Mister Reed recovered some data from their Bridge. See what you  can make of it.
TUCKER:  Let's try it again. Watch that intermix ratio.
TUCKER: Looking good. Bring her up to forty percent.
TUCKER: Shut it down. Shut it down!
ARCHER: How's it coming?
TUCKER: Could be better. Creating a stable warp field isn't easy when  the laws of physics won't cooperate. The Cochrane Equation, it's not  constant here. The problem's in the quantum variables. Every time I try  to compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack. Either we  get away from these anomalies or we're going to have to rewrite the  book on warp theory, and I don't have to tell you how long it took  Zefram Cochrane the first time around.
ARCHER: What about tactical systems?
TUCKER: Weapons should be up and running within an hour or two.
ARCHER: Make them your priority.
TUCKER: You worried about something?
ARCHER: Weapons, Trip. As quickly as you can.
TUCKER: Now where's Isaac Newton when you need him.
ARCHER: Distance?
TRAVIS: Three thousand metres and closing.
REED: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Can you give me hull plating?
REED: I'm sorry, sir.
ARCHER: Hail them.
TRAVIS: Two thousand metres.
ARCHER: Hold your fire. Are those warheads armed?
REED: Yeah.
ARCHER:  Stun grenade.
ARCHER: Go! How many more?
REED:  Two in Cargo Bay one, four more in  Engineering.
ARCHER: Get down there and help Trip. Corporal.
REED: Woods, you're with me.
HOSHI:  They're trying to download our database.
T'POL: Lock them out.
PHLOX:  Increase his anaprovaline by fifty milligrams.
ARCHER: How are they?
PHLOX: Stable. However, they've suffered extensive disruptor burns. I'd  like to start them on regeneration therapy, but the Imaging Chamber was  damaged in the attack. I'll need a repair team as soon as possible.
ARCHER: Understood.
PHLOX: Crewman Fuller. I did everything I could.
ARCHER: What about him?
PHLOX: A few internal injuries. I'll need to keep him under  observation.
ARCHER: You can observe him in the Brig. See to it.
KEMPER: Aye sir.
PHLOX: You might be interested to know that I recognise his species.  He's Osaarian.
ARCHER: He's not from the Expanse?
PHLOX: Not originally.
ARCHER:  How bad is it?
TUCKER: They made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasma  rifles, two dozen stun grenades, Chef says they cleaned out half of the  food stores, Cargo Bay two's been stripped to the bulkheads, but that's  not the worst of it. They took every one of our antimatter storage  pods. All we've got left is what's in the main reactor.
ARCHER: How long will that last, a month?
TUCKER: Tops. After that we're out of gas.
ARCHER:  This is all you've got?
T'POL: High Command hasn't had much contact with the Osaarians. They  have a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy.
ARCHER: Any luck tracking their ship?
T'POL: Not yet. They've found a way to mask their ion trail.
ARCHER: For a people with no history of piracy, they've gotten pretty  good at it. Keep looking.
T'POL: It appears they've adapted their weapons and engines to  compensate for the anomalies. Pursuing them will be dangerous. We  should consider other alternatives.
ARCHER: Such as what? Waiting for our antimatter to run dry?
T'POL: I'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our  supplies elsewhere.
ARCHER: Keep looking.
ARCHER:   Open it.
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox said your injuries were minor. Please get  up.
ORGOTH: Why?
ARCHER: I have a dead crewman.
ORGOTH: I didn't kill him.
ARCHER: No, one of your friends did. But I don't have one of your  friends, I have you, so get up and look at me.  Thank you. You're going to help me find your ship,  and after I've taken back what they stole from me, you and your  colleagues are free to go.
ORGOTH: If you went anywhere near that ship you'd have more than one  dead crewman. I can't help you. Even if I could, my Captain wouldnn't  be very interested in having me back, would he. Not after I told you  where to find him.
ARCHER: That's a risk you'll have to take, because the alternative is  going to be a lot less pleasant.
ORGOTH: I don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man.  You and your crewmates are far too civilised for that. Too moral.
ARCHER: I need what was stolen from me. There's too much at stake to  let my morality get in the way.
ORGOTH: You're obviously new to this Expanse. If you weren't, your  ship's hull would be insulated with trellium-D. Do you have any idea  what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with  trellium-D? What it can do to the people inside that ship?
ARCHER: You masked your ion trail. How?
ORGOTH: Well, my Captain's a very clever man. He has to be. When you're  forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have to  be clever. You need to know how to hide.
ARCHER: So you were forced into piracy.
ORGOTH: When we entered this Expanse we were no different than you. Two  merchant ships looking for trade routes. Then the first distortion hit  us. We decided to return home, but the perimeter, the thermobaric  clouds, let you in but they don't let you out. One of our ships was  destroyed trying. After a few more encounters with the anomalies it  wasn't long before we became predators. This section of the Expanse  proved to be ideal for hunting. When a ship runs aground due to spatial  distortions it becomes an easy target. Our Captain told us we wouldn't  harm anyone, and we didn't. Not at first. It takes time to learn to  kill without remorse. You're not prepared to kill, or torture. Not yet.
ARCHER: I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship, and if  that ends up causing me remorse, then it's something I'm willing to  live with. Think about it.
T'POL:  I've been studying the data  recovered from the derelict. Apparently, they decided to look for the  Osaarians as well. They found a way to modify their sensors to detect  the ion trail. Their life support failed before they had a chance to  start.
ARCHER: Did they leave a record of the modifications?
T'POL: I've already given it to Ensign Mayweather.
ARCHER: What's our tactical situation.
T'POL: Hull plating's back online. We should have phase cannons within  the hour.
ARCHER: Torpedoes?
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty modifying the  guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies.
ARCHER: I'll be in the Armoury.
REED: Black tea, hot. You finished rewriting the physics books?
TUCKER: I don't think I'll be taking home a Nobel prize anytime soon.
REED: A few hours rest might do you a world of good.
TUCKER: No kidding.
REED: You still can't sleep?
TUCKER: T'Pol's been trying to help, showing me how to stimulate my  neural nodes. It's not what you think.
REED: I wasn't thinking anything.
TUCKER: How are the weapons coming?
REED: The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems online,  but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. Fuller knew  those torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace.  Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunate  we haven't lost more people.
TUCKER: I doubt he'll be the last.
REED: There's no reason to get cynical.
TUCKER: Every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. We might  as well paint a giant bulls-eye on the hull.
REED: What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth?
TUCKER: All I'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds or  not, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time.
TRAVIS:  The trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead.
ARCHER: Any sign of a ship?
TRAVIS: Nothing.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Curious. The trail resumes after another seventy thousand  kilometres.
ARCHER: Let's see it. 
TRAVIS: Shall I alter course?
ARCHER: Not yet. Why would there be such a large gap?
T'POL: Their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds.
HOSHI: There would still be some residual particles.
REED: Captain, the particle decay rates don't match. This one is at  least nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago.
ARCHER: Bring weapons online. Take us to where the first trail ends.
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: I'm not reading anything.
REED: Power's fluctuating. Forward plating's down.
T'POL: Microfractures are forming on the outer hull. We should come  about.
ARCHER: Keep going.
ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL: It's approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter.
ARCHER: Ever seen anything like it?
T'POL: No. It's constructed entirely of a single alloy.
REED: Who could build something that big?
ARCHER: Take us in closer.
REED: That cloaking field is enormous. Whoever built this thing went to  a great deal of trouble to conceal it.
ARCHER: Judging from those ion trails, the Osaarians spent over eight  hours here. I want to find out why. Any luck scanning the interior?
T'POL: Our sensors are being deflected.
ARCHER: See if you can find something that looks like a way in. Take us  into orbit.
T'POL: I'm detecting what appears to be a portal, twenty two degrees  north of our current position.
ARCHER: Put it up.
ARCHER: Can you  tell what the door's made of?
T'POL: Polyduranium. The same metal as the Osaarian's hull.
ARCHER: Can we fit through?
TRAVIS: Not with Enterprise.
ARCHER: Then get a pod ready.
REED: We've cycled through the standard frequencies.
ARCHER: Did you find the locking mechanism?
REED: On the lower right side.
ARCHER: Hold our position.
ARCHER: Try it now.
TRAVIS: There's no indication of any ships, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL : Go ahead.
ARCHER: We're heading in.
T'POL : Understood.
TRAVIS: There's enough energy running through here to power a dozen  cities.
REED: What's that down there?
ARCHER: Those modules have a breathable atmosphere.
REED: Let's hope there's no one home.
ARCHER: Do you see that docking port, Ensign?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
REED: We're all clear, sir.
ARCHER: They've been busy. We've a lot of modules to search. Fan out,  keep open comm. links.
REED: They're not going to run out of stem-bolts any time soon. This  way. Starfleet ration packs.
ARCHER: Archer.
TRAVIS : I've found something, Captain.
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: Over here, sir.
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure  it's a cargo manifest.
ARCHER: How's your Osaarian?
TRAVIS: Not very good, sir.
ARCHER: Download what you can. Get it to Hoshi. Tell T'Pol we're going  to need another search team.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
REED: Check behind those canisters.
TRAVIS: Look at this.
PHLOX: Commander.
TUCKER: I had a little accident, Doc. I was reinstalling the deuterium  injectors. One of them must have had a little juice left in it.
PHLOX: Second degree burn. Why don't you have a seat.
TUCKER: I could have sworn that injector was depolarised. I guess I'm  getting a little punchy.
PHLOX: When's the last time you slept?
TUCKER: I got a full hour last night.
PHLOX: I'm surprised the neuro-pressure isn't helping. T'Pol told me  your first treatment went well.
TUCKER: Well, we only had the one session. Haven't had a lot of free  time lately.
PHLOX: Are you certain that's the reason?
TUCKER: What do you mean?
PHLOX: Vulcan neuro-pressure requires a certain degree of intimacy. I  can understand that it might make you uncomfortable.
TUCKER: It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I just can't afford to spend  an hour every night in T'Pol's quarters. Can you just give me another  one of those injections? They put me out like a light.
PHLOX: They're not meant to be taken for extended periods. There is  another treatment that might be helpful.
TUCKER: All right, what have you got?
PHLOX: Aldebaran mud leeches.
TUCKER: What am I supposed to do with them?
PHLOX: Place one on your chest and one on your abdomen an hour before  going to bed. Their secretions act as a natural sedative. Oh, please be  careful to sleep on your back. If you roll over, you might anger them.
TUCKER: Maybe an hour a night with T'Pol isn't so bad.
T'POL:  The search teams have found nearly eighty percent of our antimatter.  They're looking for the rest.
ARCHER: It's probably running through the reactor of that Osaarian  ship.
T'POL: We've also recovered most of our weapons.
ARCHER: How's Trip doing?
T'POL: He'll have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes.
ARCHER: Have the away teams speed it up. I want to go to warp as soon  as they're back.
T'POL: Quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old.
ARCHER: What else?
T'POL: The structure contains seven fusion reactors. Each one is almost  twelve kilometres long. Only three are still operational.
ARCHER: Any idea what they were designed for?
T'POL: The sphere's emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. It  may have something to do with the spatial anomalies.
ARCHER: Take as many scans as you can.
HOSHI : Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI:  While I was translating the cargo manifest, something caught my eye.  Look at these markings. I had to double-check, but I was pretty sure  that I had seen this ideography before. This is a piece of the Xindi  probe that crashed on Earth. At least three of the symbols are an exact  match.
ARCHER:  Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel. I want to know everything you can  tell me about them.
ORGOTH: Xindi?
ARCHER: You heard me.
ORGOTH: I don't remember a species with that name.
ARCHER: You're lying. Your manifest said you took their ship less than  two weeks ago.
ORGOTH: What manifest?
ARCHER: Tell me what you know.
ORGOTH: It was a small ship, they were no match for us.
ARCHER: Where are they now?
ARCHER: You destroyed them?
ORGOTH: They resisted. We had no choice.
ARCHER: Where did they come from?
ORGOTH: I have better things to do than familiarise myself with our  victims.
ARCHER: Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like?
ORGOTH: I don't remember.
ARCHER: Are you sure?
ORGOTH: Your threats aren't very convincing. I told you, you're too  civilised.
ARCHER: We'll see about that.
GUARD: Sir!
ARCHER: As you were.
ARCHER:   Ensign.
ORGOTH: Are you taking me to your torture chamber?
ARCHER: Shut up.
ARCHER: Get in.
ARCHER: The Xindi.
ORGOTH: This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain.
ARCHER: This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres  per minute.
ARCHER: You'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds you  won't be able to. The Xindi.
REED: Captain?
ARCHER: Everything's under control, Lieutenant.
REED: The airlock's decompressing, sir. He'll die.
ARCHER: Not for another twenty seconds he won't. The Xindi.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: Your memory getting any better?  Say again?
REED: Captain!
ARCHER: Take him back to the Brig.
REED: Let's go.
T'POL:  Was he cooperative?
ARCHER: Eventually. When they attacked the Xindi ship they took more  than fuel and supplies. They downloaded their database. How close would  we have to get to tap into their main computer?
HOSHI: Pretty close. Less than a kilometre, but we need to have the  access codes.
ARCHER: He gave them to me. Here.
T'POL: They are heavily armed. Are you sure it's wise to engage them?
ARCHER: I want that database. Go to Tactical Alert. Tell Trip we're  going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating.
TRAVIS: Their ion trail's already started to decay. They're going to be  hard to find.
ARCHER: We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis.
TRAVIS:  Something's passing through the cloaking field.
ARCHER: Move us into position.  Stand by. Have they detected  us?
T'POL: Not yet.
ARCHER: Open a channel.
HOSHI: Go ahead.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed that  our weapons are back online. You're outgunned, so stand down.  
TRAVIS: They're moving off.
ARCHER: One kilometre, Travis.  Get ready.
REED: Hull plating's holding.
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the cloaking field.
ARCHER: Stay with them.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: We're not close enough.
TRAVIS: Stand by.
HOSHI: Another fifty metres. I'm into the computer.
T'POL: Anything?
HOSHI: I haven't found the Xindi database. I'm losing them.
ARCHER: Travis!
T'POL: Forward hull plating is offline.
HOSHI: I've found it, Captain.
ARCHER: How long do you need?
HOSHI: A few minutes.
T'POL: Hull fracture on E deck, section fourteen. We're venting  atmosphere.
ARCHER: Emergency bulkheads.
HOSHI: They're getting too far away. I'm losing the comm. link again.
TRAVIS: Our impulse drive's destabilising. We've got to get out of the  cloaking field, sir.
ARCHER: Head back to the sphere.
ARCHER: Where are  they?
TRAVIS: Still inside the field.
ARCHER: How much did you get?
HOSHI: About a third of it.
ARCHER: Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure them  back in here. Use our forward phase cannon. Fire a single burst,  minimum yield.
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: No sign of them.
ARCHER: Again.
TRAVIS: That got their attention. They're coming through.
ARCHER: Stay within a kilometre. Return fire.
HOSHI: I'm back in.
ARCHER: Can you take out their engines?
REED: Not without risking damage to their main computer.
ARCHER: Ensign.
HOSHI: I've got eighty percent, eighty five.
T'POL: Hull plating's offline. They're targeting our reactor.
HOSHI: I've got ninety percent.
ARCHER: Good enough. Mister Reed.
REED: Their engines are down.
ARCHER: Keep our weapons locked on them.
ARCHER:  Your codes worked.  Get him out of there.
ORGOTH: Now that I've served my purpose you're taking me back to the  airlock?
ARCHER: Escort him to the Launch bay. We're taking you back to the  sphere.
ORGOTH: So you have let your morality get in the way after all. Mercy  is not a quality that will serve you well in the Expanse, Captain.
ARCHER:  Computer, load the Xindi database.
