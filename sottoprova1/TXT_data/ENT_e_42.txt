REED: Sensors can't identify its hull composition.  There doesn't even seem to be a warp signature.
T'POL: It's approaching at warp six.
ARCHER: How big is it?
REED: It's big, more than five hundred metres across.
HOSHI: We're in visual range.
ARCHER: Put it up.
ARCHER: Look  familiar?
T'POL: It's not in the Vulcan database.
ARCHER: Try hailing them.
HOSHI: No response, sir. I'm not even detecting a transceiver on board.
TRAVIS: They're gaining on us, sir.
REED: What the hell is that?
ARCHER: Tactical alert.
REED: Weapons aren't charging, sir. They're offline. Phase cannons,  torpedoes.
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge!
ARCHER : Go ahead.
TUCKER: What's going on, Captain? The engines just went down.
ARCHER : Warp or impulse?
TUCKER: Both.
ARCHER: Hold on, Trip. Have they dropped out of  warp?
T'POL: There's no way to tell. Our sensors can't penetrate their hull.
ARCHER: What about our life support?
T'POL: Fully operational.
ARCHER: That's one piece of good news. Any biosigns out there?
T'POL: None that I can detect.
ARCHER: Rotate the dorsal camera.
ARCHER: Hold it there. Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get closer.
T'POL: The vapour doesn't contain any elements our sensors can  identify.
ARCHER: Any atmosphere?
T'POL: Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon.
ARCHER: Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in Launch bay one.
TUCKER : Aye, sir.
ARCHER:  You're in charge. Keep a channel open.
REED: Captain, look at this.
REED: The atmosphere's changing. Seventy six percent nitrogen, twenty one  percent oxygen.
TUCKER: Somebody seems to know what we like to breathe.
ARCHER: What's the temperature?
REED: Eighteen degrees.
TUCKER: Florida in November.
ARCHER: Let's see what we can find.
TUCKER: Look at that.
REED: I'm not reading anything. It's like they're not there.
TUCKER: They sure look there to me.
REED: If there aren't any life-forms here, then who modified the  atmosphere?
ARCHER: I doubt it's a coincidence.
TUCKER: Captain.
ARCHER: We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things sure  look alive to me.
ARCHER: Are you okay? Trip?
TUCKER: What the hell happened?
ARCHER: That's what I was about to ask you.
TUCKER: I think I was up on the ceiling with those things. I was  looking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. I can't explain  it.
ARCHER: We should get him back to the ship.
TUCKER: I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa. She was  afraid it was getting too dark.
REED: It sounds like you were dreaming, Commander.
TUCKER: I know the difference between a dream and something really  happening.
ARCHER: We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth, Trip.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, I was there.
PHLOX: I'm not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or wisps of smoke.  He seems in perfect working order.
ARCHER: He said he had some kind of out-of-body experience.
TUCKER: I don't forget Florida, Captain. I don't care how far away it  is. I was there.
PHLOX: It's a very common hallucination,  returning to a familiar place.
TUCKER: What happened to the comm.? You three talking about me?
PHLOX: You're clear, Commander. Free  to go.
TUCKER: Thanks, Doc.
ARCHER: You sure you're all right?
TUCKER: I'm fine. I can't believe how amazing it was.
ARCHER: I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days, but I can't  afford to. I need you to get those engines back online.
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do.
ARCHER: Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon Beach.
TUCKER: Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted.
ARCHER: I want those weapons back online, too.
REED: I'll see what I can do.
ARCHER: Come in.
ARCHER: It's like we're in  the belly of the beast.
T'POL: We have no reason to believe their motives are hostile.
ARCHER: They're holding my ship hostage.
T'POL: We don't know that.
ARCHER: We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars? Our engines are  offline, our weapons. Seems kind of hostile to me.
T'POL: I suppose it depends on how you look at it.
ARCHER: Is there something you wanted to see me about?
T'POL: Ensign Sato is trying to communicate with the life forms.
ARCHER: And?
T'POL: Nothing yet. I've spoken to a number of officers. They say the  crew is concerned, but remaining calm.
ARCHER: I've got to get them out of here.
ROSTOV: I tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the power grid  isn't charging. Commander? Are you all right, sir? Can I get you  something?
TUCKER: I'm fine. Goodbye, sir.
ROSTOV: Rostov to Captain Archer.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
ROSTOV: I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think there might be  something wrong with Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: What do you mean, wrong?
ROSTOV: He was confused, and seemed to think I was  his superior officer.
ARCHER: I'll be right down.
ROSTOV : He's not here, sir. He left Engineering.
ARCHER: Did he say where he was going?
ROSTOV: No, sir.
ROSTOV : I'm afraid not, Captain.
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker.  Find him.
ARCHER: Commander.
TUCKER: Commander Charles Tucker III.
ARCHER: Hungry?
TUCKER: Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this?
ARCHER: It's called bread. You've never eaten it before?
TUCKER: I've never eaten anything before.
T'POL: Where's Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: I'm here. Charles Tucker III.
ARCHER: Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker?
TUCKER: He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll be back.
ARCHER: I want him back now.
TUCKER: Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never thought he  could.
ARCHER: Where is he?
TUCKER: It's not a question of where. He's no longer corporeal. But he  will be again, I assure you.
REED: When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. Did  you have anything to do with that?
TUCKER: Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose you could  call us that. Wisp.
ARCHER: Where do you come from?
TUCKER: We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're explorers,  like you.
ARCHER: Why did you take Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: It's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings.  After we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realised  we were compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in bodies that  need maintenance. You have gender. You require mates to reproduce. You  eat food. We were like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn how  our ancestors lived.
ARCHER: I want my crewman, and I want my ship released.
REED: Captain.
TUCKER: Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an explorer,  Captain. Open your mind to new possibilities.
ARCHER: What about Tucker?
TUCKER: I've enjoyed my time with you.
REED: Sir.
TUCKER: Wow.
ARCHER: Wow what?
TUCKER: I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy chasing some bad  guys. Then I was with Lisa again, except this time we were snow sailing  in New Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine, picking up  leaves with my dad. But it wasn't a dream, Captain. It was as real as  I'm sitting here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the crew.
ARCHER: Who told you?
TUCKER: They did. The ones I was with.
ARCHER: I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend.
TUCKER: I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try it. You'll  understand what I'm talking about. You all should try it.
ARCHER: Take him to Sickbay.
TUCKER: Captain, I'm fine.
ARCHER: We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are.
REED: Commander.
ARCHER: Something smells funny.
T'POL: They've released the ship and Commander Tucker. They've done  everything you've asked. Have you considered they may have been telling  the truth when they said they were just curious about us?
ARCHER: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that  the Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is  to get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before  he can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life forms  have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for  Starfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she's  right. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hate  to think that was the case.  Computer, pause. Come in.
PHLOX: I hope I'm not disturbing you.
ARCHER: Everything all right?
PHLOX: I'm not certain. One of those beings appeared in Sickbay a few  minutes ago. It entered me right here.
PHLOX: But my  physiology must not have been compatible. It left almost immediately.
ARCHER: Are you sure you're all right?
PHLOX: I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was trying very  hard to reach me.
CREWWOMAN: I'm going to B deck.
REED: B deck is fine. Are you a female?
CREWWOMAN: Sir?
REED: Your gender. You are a female, correct?
CREWWOMAN: Last time I checked.
REED: I am a male.
CREWWOMAN: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.
REED: There seem to be a number of anatomical differences.
CREWWOMAN: Sir.
T'POL: Come in.
REED: Sub-Commander.
T'POL: Is there something I can do for you?
REED: You are very beautiful. Are you aware that you are the most  attractive woman on board this ship?
T'POL: Do you think it's appropriate for you to be here at this hour?
REED: Would you mind taking off your clothing? I'd like to learn more  about your anatomy.
T'POL: Have you been drinking?
REED: If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if you  disrobed.
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
T'POL: Would you please come to my quarters with a security team.
ARCHER : We're on our way.
REED: Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be.
T'POL: I'm capable of defending myself.
REED: What is it like being a female? Is it much different?
T'POL: I wouldn't know.
REED: If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out.
T'POL: I don't understand.
REED: If you came to us, you could experience what it's like to be  male. Wouldn't that be helpful to you?
T'POL: I've never thought about it.
REED: You should. We're capable of letting you experience anything you  wish for. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that.
T'POL: This isn't Lieutenant Reed.
ARCHER: Enough! Humans don't like doing things without their consent.  When are you planning to return Malcolm Reed?
REED: That depends.
ARCHER: Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy experiencing the  human condition locked in Reed's quarters.
TUCKER: Tucker.
ARCHER : They've got Malcolm. I need the ship
ARCHER: Ready to go on my command.
TUCKER : They're going to give him back, aren't they?
ARCHER: We'll see.
TUCKER: What did you do with the, er?
ARCHER: A security detail locked him in Malcolm's  quarters. Get it down, Trip.
TUCKER: Right away, sir. You heard him.  Let's try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the  injectors. Tucker to Ensign Cook.
COOK : Yes, sir.
TUCKER: I need you and two other engineers down here right away.
COOK : I'll see who I can find.
ROSTOV : Commander!
TUCKER: Quickly please. Tucker out. Something wrong?
TUCKER: Run into a problem?
ROSTOV: Problem? No, everything's fine.
TUCKER: Did you have any luck priming the pumps?
ROSTOV: I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very complex.
TUCKER: Stay here. I'll be right back. Tucker to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
TUCKER : It's Rostov, sir. I think you need to get Malcolm.
TUCKER: I mean, whoever's running Security, down  here right away.
ARCHER: Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering.  Have them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters.
HOSHI: Aye, sir. Captain, we've been getting reports from all over the  ship. Some of the crew are acting very strange.
ARCHER: Then we're going to need more than one security team. Find out  who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters.
TRAVIS: How do we know the security officers are okay?
ARCHER: For the moment, we're going to have to hope they are.  Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's  not. Maybe Phlox can help you.
COOK: Commander.
TUCKER: Run into a problem?
COOK: No, sir. Just ready to calibrate the dilithium matrix.
TUCKER: Great. Wait till I give you the signal.
HOSHI: We polarised the hull plating as soon as we  detected that ship. Obviously it didn't do any good. What's keeping  them from taking all of us?
ARCHER: Archer.
TUCKER: You've got impulse engines back, Captain.
ARCHER : Thanks, Trip.
ARCHER:  Hold our position.
HOSHI: I thought you said we needed to get out of here.
ARCHER: They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many others. Until we  find a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere.
ARCHER: What's the big secret?
T'POL: We thought it best not to discuss this over the comm. We don't  know who's been taken.
ARCHER: What have you got?
PHLOX: It was simpler than I thought. Elevated acetylcholine levels in  the autonomic nervous
ARCHER: Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work.
PHLOX: The Sub-Commander programmed the medical computer. It's  modifying this hand-scanner as we speak.
ARCHER: Get to work as soon as you're ready.
TUCKER : Tucker to Ensign Mayweather.
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir.
TUCKER : I'm a little short-handed, Travis.
TUCKER: Think I could get you to go back to the  starboard nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils?
TRAVIS: No problem, sir.
TUCKER : Call me when you get to the catwalk.
TRAVIS: I'm on my way.
T'POL: There are two here.
PHLOX: Ensign Cole and Crewman Rossi.
TRAVIS: Mayweather to the Bridge.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
TRAVIS: One of those things just followed me up the starboard strut,  but when I got into the catwalk it didn't come through. There must be  something keeping it from getting in here.
ARCHER: Then you'd better stay where you are.
TRAVIS : Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Yes, Captain?
ARCHER : Is there some kind of shielding
ARCHER: In the nacelles that might keep these  aliens from getting in?
TUCKER: The catwalk's reinforced with osmium  alloy, but it's hard to say if that would do it.
ARCHER : Travis thinks it will.
ARCHER: I need you to stop whatever you're doing  and transfer all command functions
ARCHER : To the starboard catwalk. We're going  to have to get everybody in there.
TUCKER: I'm on it.
ARCHER: I want you and T'Pol to get the crew up  there as quickly as you can. Hoshi.
HOSHI: It would be best if they stayed where they were.
ARCHER: What?
HOSHI: We're offering them a great opportunity. They may never get  another chance to experience existence as we do.
ARCHER: Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why?
HOSHI: I understand how you may be frightened by all this. Losing your  substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once  you've made the crossing, I promise you.
ARCHER: We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious to  give it up.
HOSHI: Those who've preceded you are safe and happy. They'll  understand.
ARCHER: Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours?
ARCHER: Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters.
HOSHI: You'll understand.
ARCHER: How many?
T'POL: Fifty eight, including us.
ARCHER: And outside?
T'POL: Twenty four locked in their quarters, and Doctor Phlox.
ARCHER: You okay, Travis?
TRAVIS: I'm fine, sir. Thank you.
ARCHER: Trip?
TRAVIS: I saw him down near the Command Compartment.
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: We need to learn more about these life forms.
ARCHER: What we need is to get our people back.
T'POL: It's illogical to believe we can do that without learning more  about the aliens' intentions.
ARCHER: Do you have something in mind?
T'POL: I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk.
ARCHER: You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take you  before you got back to the saucer section.
T'POL: Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to exchange its  consciousness with mine, I believe I can prevent it.
ARCHER: What makes you think that?
T'POL: No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far more disciplined  that yours. It can resist temptations, emotions, and I believe,  invasions by these lifeforms.
ARCHER: Even if you're right, what would you accomplish?
T'POL: If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief period  when our minds are conjoined. It's possible I can ascertain their  motives.
ARCHER: It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.
T'POL: There's no other choice.
ARCHER: And if you're wrong?
T'POL: It's a risk I'm willing to take.
ARCHER: Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people. I'm  not going to give them another one.
T'POL: You told me you trust my judgment. Trust it now, unless you have  another suggestion.
PHLOX: Sickbay.
HOSHI : There's been an accident.
PHLOX: Hoshi?
HOSHI : Hoshi Sato's been injured. I don't know how to repair the  damage to her body.
PHLOX: What happened?
HOSHI : Her leg is fractured. She's in considerable pain. She needs  assistance.
PHLOX: I'm armed. If you're near the door, step away.
HOSHI : She's on the floor. She can't move.
PHLOX: There's nothing the matter with you.
HOSHI: I need to find the rest of your crew. Where are they?
PHLOX:  I'm glad I brought you along.
PHLOX: Doctor Phlox.
ARCHER : Is everything going all right, Doc?
PHLOX: More or less.
ARCHER : Good. T'Pol and I are going to need your help.
PHLOX: Sub-Commander? T'Pol?
PHLOX: Have you  succeeded?
PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Did you find her?
PHLOX : I'm with her now. She's not acting like the others
PHLOX: But she's certainly not herself.
ARCHER: Doesn't sound like that's the outcome she  expected.
PHLOX : Her neural pathways are hyperstimulated.
ARCHER: Damn it. You'd better take her to her quarters.
PHLOX : Yes, Captain.
PHLOX: Come with me. Everything will be all right.
PHLOX: I'm afraid I  have to insist. I promise you
PHLOX: T'Pol! What is my name? Sub-Commander!
T'POL: They're lying to us.
PHLOX: My name.
T'POL: We don't have time for this, Phlox. I have to get to the  Captain.
T'POL: Their ship is deteriorating, and they have  no way to repair it. They can't survive in space.
ARCHER: So they are doing this to save themselves.
T'POL: Eighty two of them are. One for every crewman on Enterprise.
TRAVIS: How many of them are there?
T'POL: Hundreds. The rest will try to find another vessel of corporeal  beings. Where's Commander Tucker?
TRAVIS: I'm not sure.
T'POL: Please find him.
T'POL: If the Commander can find a way  to shield Enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to warp.
ARCHER: And lose a third of the crew?
T'POL: Two thirds will survive.
ARCHER: Unacceptable. We're going to find a way to get them back.
T'POL: That may be difficult.
ARCHER: Can they survive in a host that's dead?
T'POL: It would be no different than being exposed to space. They'd  die.
ARCHER: Archer to Phlox.
PHLOX : Yes, Captain.
TRAVIS: Are you doing all right?
CREWMAN: We're okay.
CREWMAN 2: How long do you think we'll be in here, Ensign?
TRAVIS: I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he can. Has  anyone seen Commander Tucker?
CREWMAN: No, sir.
CREWMAN 2: Not for a while. I think he was down there.
TRAVIS: Thanks.
PHLOX: We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds of  respiratory failure.
ARCHER: That'll give you enough time to  resuscitate them?
PHLOX : Oh, yes.
PHLOX: It's enough time. Don't forget to close off  the ventilation to the starboard nacelle.
PHLOX : We wouldn't want the gas to affect you  and the others.
ARCHER: Understood.
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: Has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches?
T'POL: Not since we sealed them.
ARCHER: You must've missed him.
TRAVIS: I'll look again.
PHLOX: Four, five, six, seven.
ARCHER : All right. Does it have an ID tag?
PHLOX: Junction four one alpha. Atmospheric
PHLOX : Recycling manifold.
ARCHER: Good. Do you see the releases on either side?
PHLOX : Yes. There are four of them.
PHLOX :Two blue.
PHLOX: Two silver.
ARCHER: Open them. The silver ones first.
PHLOX: Done.
ARCHER: Now pull the panel off.
PHLOX: What should I do with it?
ARCHER: Whatever you want.
ARCHER : Lay it down on the floor.
PHLOX: Very well.
PHLOX: Right where you said it was, Captain.
ARCHER: Find the control panel.
PHLOX: It's right here. It has six green lights.
ARCHER: Each of them should have a switch next to  it.
PHLOX : About five centimetres to the left.
ARCHER: Now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation,  you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon  dioxide tanks.
PHLOX: And how do I go about doing that?
T'POL: Those six switches control the feed. You're  going to have to recalibrate them in sequence for CO2.
T'POL : I'll guide you through it.
TRAVIS: Commander, I've been looking all over for  you! Are you all right, sir?
TUCKER: I'm fine.
TRAVIS: The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in the Command  Compartment. Commander!
TRAVIS: You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe!
TRAVIS: What are you doing?
PHLOX: I've reached the access tube, Captain.
ARCHER : Good. Now pull off the panel.
PHLOX:  It's not coming off.
ARCHER: It'll come off. You just need to use a  little muscle.
PHLOX: I've used every muscle I've got. it won't  budge.
ARCHER: Try using your foot
ARCHER : For leverage.
PHLOX:
ARCHER : Okay.
ARCHER: Now, the next part's a piece of cake.
TRAVIS: We've got a problem, Captain.
ARCHER: Stand by, Doc. What happened?
TRAVIS: Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward hatch.
ARCHER: What?
TRAVIS: I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like himself. I think  one of those things got inside him.
T'POL: If he knows what we're doing.
ARCHER: We're going to have to speed things up, Doc. Trip's been taken.  He left the catwalk a few minutes ago.
ARCHER : If he tries to let his buddies out of  their quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him.
PHLOX: Tell me what to do.
ARCHER: You'll have to purge the osmotic filters.
ARCHER : The valves are right behind the  control circuit. You're going to have to get two fingers through the  upper holes in the support plate.
ARCHER: Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but  wearing those gloves
ARCHER : Could make it difficult.
PHLOX: Back home, I'm known for my fine motor skills. I doubt a pair of  EV gloves
PHLOX : Will deter me.
T'POL: There are two solenoids behind the openings. When you tap them  simultaneously, the plate should retract.
PHLOX: Did you say there were two?
ARCHER: About three centimetres apart.
PHLOX: Got it.
ARCHER : You should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever.
PHLOX: I see them.
ARCHER : Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever to the  three o'clock position. That should do it.
T'POL: T'POL: The nine o'clock position will vent the gas when we're  finished.
PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER : Go ahead.
PHLOX: Mission accomplished.
PHLOX : I'm monitoring Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: Good job.
PHLOX: It's left Commander Tucker.
ARCHER : Vent the gas.
PHLOX: In a moment, Captain. I need to be certain the CO2 levels are  consistent throughout the ship, that all the lifeforms are gone.
ARCHER: Ready, Travis?
TRAVIS:  Yes, sir.
PHLOX: It's done.
ARCHER: Full impulse.
T'POL: They're in pursuit.
T'POL: Stand  by. Now.
TUCKER: What's going on, Doc?
PHLOX: Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine.
TUCKER: I was just at a barbecue.
PHLOX: In through the nose, out through the mouth.
TUCKER: I've never seen so many ribs.
PHLOX: Follow me, Commander. We have a lot of  doors to unlock.
