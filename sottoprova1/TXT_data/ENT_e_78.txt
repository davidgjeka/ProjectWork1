OFFICER: A transport shuttle, no armaments.
SOLDIER: Their engines are down. Life support failing.
CAPTAIN: Crew?
SOLDIER: Two biosigns, human.
CAPTAIN: Tractor beam. Send a squad to the docking port.
SOLDIER: Move! Walk, human!
CAPTAIN: Contact the High Council. Inform them of  the prisoners. Request instructions.
OFFICER: Commander, disruptor fire near the brig.
CAPTAIN: QI'yaH!
VOICE : You have a visitor.
SOONG: I'm busy.
VOICE : Stand up, Doctor.
VOICE : Arms.
SOONG: Jonathan Archer. What brings you here? They're naming the prison  after you?
ARCHER: I need to ask you some questions.
SOONG: I'm kind of in the middle of something.
ARCHER: It won't take long.
SOONG: Well. I suppose it's not every day one gets to speak to the man  who saved the planet. Please.  I apologise  for the clutter. I'm not allowed traditional recording devices.
ARCHER: You programmed a PADD to unlock every security door in the  building.
SOONG: I was particularly proud of that. I made it all the way to  Sausalito. On the rare occasion I get stuck on a problem, I find a  vigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head.  Go ahead. They're DNA sequences. That one is for a modification  of the human T-cell. It would render Sharat Syndrome a thing of the  past. That one increases the visual spectrum by five percent. Of  course, none of this will ever be tested. They clear out my room every  few months. I'm told it all gets vaporised.
ARCHER: Why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever  use?
SOONG: How can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology that  would enhance ability, relieve suffering?
ARCHER: Genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering.
SOONG: So did splitting the atom, yet the first ships to colonise the  solar system were nuclear-powered. But you're not here to discuss that.
ARCHER: Someone attacked a Klingon Bird of Prey. The entire crew was  massacred. The ship is missing.
SOONG: I read the reports. I understand the Klingons are quite annoyed.  Looks like you might've saved Earth for nothing.
ARCHER: Whoever's responsible jettisoned the Klingon crew into space.  DNA was recovered from the bodies.
SOONG: Let me guess. Human?
ARCHER: Not quite.
SOONG: I see.
ARCHER: They were Augments. Their genetically-enhanced DNA matched  embryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago. Stolen by  you.
ARCHER: Soong used to work at Cold Station 12, a top secret medical  research station.
REED: Isn't that where Starfleet keeps a stockpile of infectious  diseases?
ARCHER: Along with genetically-engineered embryos left over from the  Eugenics Wars. It's been kept from the public for obvious reasons.
TRAVIS: I remember Soong's trial. He wouldn't say what he did with the  embryos he stole.
ARCHER: Now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the Trialus  System and raised them. They were around ten years old when he was  captured, a decade ago.
TUCKER: So there could be a bunch of Augments from the Eugenics Wars  running around loose.
TRAVIS: Not a pretty thought.
REED: What would they want with a Klingon Bird of Prey?
ARCHER: We don't know. Neither does Soong. At least he claims he  doesn't. But he does think he can convince them to surrender without a  fight.
REED: You're bringing him along.
ARCHER: There's also the fact that he spent time in the Borderland.
HOSHI: The Borderland?
REED: The area where the Klingon ship was attacked.
T'POL: It's a volatile region between the Klingon Empire and the Orion  Syndicate. It attracts the most dangerous elements from both.
HOSHI: Sorry I asked.
ARCHER: The Klingons have threatened to retaliate with everything  they've got. We're the fastest ship and the most experienced crew. We  have to find the Augments and bring them back. It's the only way to  avert a war. We launch in six hours.
PERSIS:  We've mastered their engine  controls.
MALIK:  Wing-mounted  disruptor cannons, photon torpedo launchers. This ship's an arsenal.
PERSIS: We're finally free.
RAAKIN: A fine ship.
MALIK: I thought you'd be pleased.
RAAKIN: I didn't sanction this attack. If you'd failed, they would've  come after all of us.
MALIK: I didn't fail.
RAAKIN: Their government knows what we did. They have ships hunting for  us right now.
MALIK: They won't find us. It was time for us to leave this godforsaken  planet.
RAAKIN: That was my decision, not yours! You've forgotten who I am?  Have you?!
MALIK: No, Raakin.
RAAKIN: Say it.
MALIK: You are our leader.
RAAKIN:  Don't ever make me ask you again. Notify  me when the rest of our supplies are onboard. We're leaving orbit.
SOONG: Permission to come  aboard, sir?
ARCHER: This is my Science Officer, T'Pol.
SOONG: No need for an introduction. I admire your people very much. We  share a similar view of humanity.
T'POL: What view is that?
SOONG: That it could stand some improvement.
T'POL: I believe that's true of most species, if not all.
ARCHER: My Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Doctor.
SOONG: I've heard of you, but I don't recognise your face. You're not  getting your fair share of publicity.
REED: I think I've had all I can stand.
ARCHER: We've prepared some quarters. You'll be under guard at all  times. If you should decide you need to clear your head.
SOONG: We're on a starship soon to be at high warp. Where exactly would  I go?
ARCHER: It's this way.
SOONG: If I could examine the DNA samples the Klingons recovered, I  could tell you something about the current state of the Augments.
ARCHER: I'll have the information sent to your quarters.
SOONG: A laboratory would be preferable, your Sickbay. Doctor Phlox's  reputation rivals my own, before I was imprisoned, of course. I'd enjoy  trading notes with him.
ARCHER: I'll consider it.
TUCKER: So, how was the honeymoon?
T'POL: Honeymoon?
TUCKER: You were on Vulcan another two weeks after I left. I figured
TUCKER: It comes with everything but its own protein resequencer. For  that, I'll need another day.
ARCHER: I like it.
TUCKER: We don't have time to go over all the details. Just try not to  hit that button.
HOSHI: We're cleared for launch.
ARCHER: Here we are again.
ARCHER: Wouldn't  have it any other way. Travis.
ARCHER: I just received an intelligence report. A  Klingon warship was spotted near Proxima colony. Admiral Forrest thinks  they could be conducting reconnaissance for a future strike. I wanted  to keep you up to date.
T'POL: My government is trying to work out a diplomatic solution.  There's still a chance they'll be successful.
ARCHER: Small chance. One other thing.
ARCHER: It's your first official day of duty, Commander  T'Pol. A present. It's from the early  twentieth century.  Should help keep you pointed in the right direction.
ARCHER: I'm glad you're with us.
T'POL: Thank you, Captain.
SOONG: Malik. He was  the rebellious one. Reminded me of myself when I was his age. I came to  think of them as my own children.
PHLOX: It must've been difficult for you to leave them behind.
SOONG: I knew they'd survive.
PHLOX: This is extremely sophisticated work for twentieth century  Earth.
SOONG: Well, I made some modifications of my own.
PHLOX: Really? What kind of modifications?
SOONG: I prefer to let my work speak for itself.
PHLOX: I think it already has.
SOONG: I didn't realise you shared humanity's reactionary attitude  toward this field of medicine.
PHLOX: On the contrary, we've used genetic engineering on Denobula for  over two centuries, to generally positive effect.
SOONG: But you don't approve of what I've done.
PHLOX: You tried to redesign your species. The first time that was  attempted on Earth, the result was thirty million deaths.
SOONG: We can't let past mistakes hold us back.
PHLOX: It's your responsibility as a scientist to learn from past  mistakes.
SOONG: Well, what makes you think I haven't?
PHLOX: I can read.
REED: Two vessels are coming up behind us.
T'POL: Orion Interceptors.
ARCHER: Interesting way of saying hello. Hoshi?
HOSHI: No response.
TUCKER: We're getting hammered down here!
ARCHER: Keep firing.
T'POL: I'm picking up an energy surge from one of the interceptors.
ARCHER: A weapon?
T'POL: No.
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge. Two of my people just  disappeared.
REED: The interceptors have jumped to warp. They're  gone.
ARCHER: They took nine people, including T'Pol.
SOONG: There never used to be Orions in this area. They must've  expanded their range of operations. It's a shame. I really liked your  Science Officer.
ARCHER: How do I get them back?
SOONG: It's not going to be easy.
ARCHER: That's not what I asked you.
SOONG: They've most likely been taken to a processing station. The  nearest one's on Verex Three.
ARCHER:  Archer to Bridge.
REED : Reed.
ARCHER: Set a course for Verex Three, best possible speed.
REED : Yes, sir.
ARCHER: What'll happen to them there?
SOONG: They'll be ushered into their new profession, as slaves. These  stations are heavily guarded. Only legitimate traders are permitted to  enter.
ARCHER: I have the feeling you've found your way in.
SOONG: I had to establish a relationship with the Orions. They helped  me acquire certain goods and equipment I needed to survive. I can get  you inside, but I can't get your people out.
ARCHER: One step at a time.
MALIK: Raakin is taking us to another system where  we can live out our lives in peace. But I'm sure he's already told you  that.
PERSIS: He doesn't tell me everything.
MALIK: This isn't what our father would've wanted. He didn't raise us  to run away and hide.
PERSIS: Well, what do you propose?
MALIK: You could try to convince Raakin to reconsider.
PERSIS: He only wants one thing from me, and it isn't advice.
MALIK: It doesn't suit you.
PERSIS: What?
MALIK: Playing the victim. You chose Raakin. You wanted the strongest  for yourself.
PERSIS: I still do. What is it you want?
PERSIS: There's plenty of time for that.
SLAVER: You are now the property of the Orion Syndicate. Break the  rules, and you will suffer. Follow the rules, and you will suffer less.  Take her.
T'POL: Ensign.
PIERCE: Commander!
T'POL: Are you all right?
PIERCE: This thing, it hurts.
T'POL: Don't touch it. Have you seen anyone else from the ship?
PIERCE: Just you. Where are we?
T'POL: An Orion slave market.
PIERCE: Slave market?
T'POL: The Orions traffic in forced labour. We're being processed for  auction.
PIERCE: This can't be happening. They're going to come for us, right?  The ship?
T'POL: Ensign.
PIERCE: The Captain's going to get us out of here!
T'POL: Ensign. I don't know your name.
PIERCE: Pierce. Jeffrey Pierce. I just signed on.
T'POL: Jeffrey, Enterprise will come. It may take some time. We should  try to stay together until they get here.
ALIEN : Transmit your identification code.
REED: Soong hasn't used this code in years.
ARCHER: Give it time.
ALIEN : You're cleared to proceed.
ARCHER: Phlox. Transponder. It has a range of ten kilometres.
TUCKER: You wander off more than a step or two, we bring you right back  here.
SOONG: You don't like me, do you, Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: No, I don't.
SOONG: You probably blame me for what's happened to your Vulcan friend.
ARCHER: That's enough.
SOONG: Your crew could use a sense of humour.
ARCHER: Make the engines a priority. When it's time to leave, I have a feeling  we're going to need all the speed we can get.
PIERCE: I've read every transcript of every  mission. I thought I was prepared, that I knew what to expect. Boy, was  I wrong.
T'POL: If you wish, I can teach you how to minimise your anxiety.
PIERCE: Yeah, I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.
PIERCE: Leave her alone!
T'POL: Ensign, don't!
SLAVER: You're doing well.
SLAVER: Three  million six! Not even my last wife sold for that much.
ORION: Stand up. Bring that woman.
ARCHER: Over here.
SOONG: At least we know four of your people are still here. Doesn't  seem to be much demand for humans.
ARCHER: Those devices on their necks.
SOONG: Neurolytic restraints. Ingenious, really. They induce convulsive  seizures in disobedient slaves. If a slave attempts to leave the  premises.
ARCHER: So if we try to beam them out?
SOONG: Wouldn't recommend it, not if you want them alive.
ARCHER: They sell their own people?
SOONG: Only the women. Orion females are known for their extreme  appetites, their innate skills.
ARCHER: Come on.
ARCHER: T'Pol. You all right?
T'POL: How many were taken?
ARCHER: Nine. We've located five, so far. We're working on a way to try  and
ORION: She's sold. Buyers are over there.
SOONG: We made a wrong turn. Thank you so much, though. Thank you for  your help. Really, thank you. Let's go.
RAAKIN: He argues with every command I give, defies me in front of the  others.
PERSIS: Some of them agree with what he did, taking this ship.
RAAKIN: They've forgotten how we've stayed alive all these years. My  resolve was what kept us from starving to death on that rock.
PERSIS: They believe it's Malik who liberated us from that rock.
RAAKIN: You agree with them.
PERSIS: How can you say that?
RAAKIN: I hear it in your voice.
PERSIS: Malik's doing more than arguing with your  commands. He's plotting against you. He wants to take your place.
RAAKIN: How do you know that?
PERSIS: He told me. Malik's always wanted me. I knew he was planning  something, so I let him think I wanted him as well. He said that you're  weak, that you're making all of us weak, that you're betraying Father's  principles, that if Father were here, he'd choose Malik to lead us.
RAAKIN: I will betray Father's principles. I'm going to kill my own  brother.
SLAVER: If you don't sell as a slave, I will sell you as food.
SLAVER: Oh, that's barely enough to  cover the expense of processing you.
ARCHER:  Archer to Enterprise.
TUCKER : Tucker here.
ARCHER: We've located everyone, including T'Pol. I'm going to need six  kilos of tritanium cobalt.
SOONG: Nine.
ARCHER : Make that nine.
TUCKER: That's half our supply.
ARCHER: I'll explain later. Just get it ready.
TUCKER : Yes, sir.
ARCHER: They normally remove the restraint after a sale. We used the  extra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leave  it on him.
TUCKER: Why can't we just buy the rest of our people?
ARCHER: T'Pol's already been sold. We don't have time to try and buy  them all.
PHLOX: We're almost there. Try to hold still.
TUCKER: What kind of people are these?
SOONG: I'd say they're not unlike some of your ancestors, judging from  your accent.
TUCKER: Well, if I remember my history, these Augments you love so much  had plenty of slaves.
SOONG: They were more like subjects.
TUCKER: Oh. They were just treated like slaves.
ARCHER: T'Pol could be shipped out any second. Work fast.
PERSIS: I told him everything. He thinks you're planning an attack  against him.
MALIK: Is he going to move against me?
RAAKIN:  See for yourself. Is this the move you  expected?
RAAKIN: It's between us. I saved your life  once when we were children, pulled you from the river when you fell in.
MALIK: I remember.
RAAKIN: Now, ten years later, you're plotting against me.
MALIK: I'm the strongest and the smartest.
RAAKIN: Doesn't look that way from here. You would never have trapped  me like this.
MALIK: But I have.
PERSIS: I'm sorry, Raakin.
MALIK: It's between us.
RAAKIN: Saul, Jaya, listen to me.
MALIK: They only listen to me now. There was a time when I looked up to  you, when I called you my brother.
RAAKIN: I am your brother.
MALIK: When you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of  us, and when that happened, you ceased to exist.
MALIK: Which makes this an act of mercy. Get rid of him.
MALIK: Don't. Not for him.
TUCKER : We're sending the code now.
ARCHER: Got it.
SLAVER: Outside. Outside!
PRISONER: The restraints are off!
SLAVER: Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose!
ARCHER: Trip, start beaming them, five at a time.
SOONG: Sorry, Captain. I hope you find your people. Thanks for the  ride.
SLAVER: You've got spirit. I might  just keep you for myself.
T'POL: I'm not for sale.
ARCHER: Trip, have you got everyone?
TUCKER: You and Soong are the only ones left.
ARCHER : Soong got away.
ARCHER: Locate him and beam him up.
TUCKER: Soong's transponder signal, it's dead.
ARCHER: Can you scan for his biosign?
TUCKER: We're trying, but there's too many people  down there.
ALIEN: Help me. Don't let them take me.
ARCHER: Trip, two to beam up.
ARCHER: You knew exactly where the Orions were operating. You knew  they'd abduct members of my crew. Maybe you were even hoping they'd get  you.
SOONG: There was an outside chance.
ARCHER: You were determined to escape, no matter who got hurt.
SOONG: No one was injured.
ARCHER: Nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery. Two of them  may have permanent physical damage because of the restraints.
SOONG: I didn't take this action lightly.
ARCHER: Is that supposed to justify what you did?
SOONG: I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me to place you and your  crew in jeopardy. I respect you, Captain.
ARCHER: Then tell me how to find the Augments. You know where they're  going.
SOONG: They didn't steal a Klingon ship to go sightseeing.
ARCHER: They're dangerous.
SOONG: They're the future. They're stronger, smarter, free from  sickness, with life spans twice as long as our own. You, more than  anyone, should appreciate what this means.
ARCHER: Why me?
SOONG: Your father suffered from Clarke's Disease. His final years were  marked with extreme pain.
ARCHER: My father has nothing to do with this.
SOONG: He didn't need to suffer. Genetic engineering could've cured  him. Those who want to suppress my Augments are the same ones who  condemned your father to death. Turn the ship around, Captain. Go home.  Leave them alone.
ARCHER: I'm going to find them, Doctor, whether you help me or not.
TUCKER: You're supposed to be resting.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox says I can resume my duties this afternoon.
TUCKER: I'm glad they got that thing off with no problem.
T'POL: There's a slight ringing in my left ear, but it should dissipate  over time.
TUCKER: Good. Well, I'll let you get back to that.
T'POL: Vulcans don't have honeymoons. After the ceremony, I went to  Mount Seleya to meditate alone.
TUCKER: It's none of my business, anyway.
REED: Orion Interceptors, two of them. Coming up  fast.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the Starship
SLAVER : You've stolen our property!
ARCHER: They were members of my crew. You kidnapped them.
SLAVER : Disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your weapons.
ARCHER: That isn't going to happen.  Malcolm.
REED: They're targeting our nacelles.
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Torpedoes.
TRAVIS: There's another ship.
REED: The second Orion is veering off. They're retreating.
HOSHI: The Klingons are requesting to dock.
MALIK: I know he's on this ship. We received his signal.
ARCHER: When he tried to escape, I saw him access a console.
MALIK: You were expecting us. Where is he?
ARCHER: In the Brig.
MALIK: In a prison cell? I want to speak with him.
ARCHER: I can't allow that.
MALIK: We saved your ship.
ARCHER: My ship wouldn't have been in danger if we hadn't come looking  for you.
MALIK: What is it you want with us?
ARCHER: My orders are to take you back to Earth.
MALIK: Earth considers my father a criminal. Why? Because he brought us  to life. You want to take us back to a world that opposes our very  existence.
ARCHER: You attacked a Klingon vessel. They're threatening war.
MALIK: That's not our problem. We don't care what happens to you.  Humanity is no longer relevant. To quote one of your philosophers,  Nietzsche, mankind is something to be surpassed.
ARCHER: You think he was talking about you?
MALIK: I'm about to attack you.
MALIK: You see?  Even with a warning, you're not fast enough.
REED: Let him go.
REED: Let him go.
MALIK: I'll tear out his throat. Lower your weapons. Now.
MALIK: Persis.
PERSIS: I've broken their security code. We're  ready.
MALIK: I'll kill  him.
PERSIS: Persis.
SOONG: Persis?  I can't believe it.
PERSIS: Father, here's Malik.
SOONG: Malik.
SOONG: I knew we'd see each other again. I'm proud of you. Of all  of you.
ARCHER: Soong, listen to me.
SOONG: There's nothing to say, Captain.
MALIK: What should we do with them?
SOONG: Let them go.
MALIK: But they'll just come after us.
SOONG: Their ship's disabled. By the time it's repaired, we'll be far  away. It's been a pleasure, Captain. Take my advice. Go home and start  learning how to speak Klingon.
SOONG: There were times back on Earth when I doubted myself, my work.  But seeing you all, I know that everything I've fought for was worth  it. We're going to build a new world. But we can't begin that task just  yet. Thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born.  Let's go get them.
