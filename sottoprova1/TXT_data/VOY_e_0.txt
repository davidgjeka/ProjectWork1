CHAKOTAY:  Damage report.
TUVOK:  Shields at sixty percent.
TORRES:  A fuel line has ruptured. Attempting to  compensate. Damn it! We're barely maintaining impulse. I can't get any  more out of it.
CHAKOTAY: Be creative!
TORRES: How am I supposed to be creative with a thirty nine year old  rebuilt engine?
GUL EVEK : Maquis ship, this is Gul Evek of the  Cardassian Fourth Order. Cut your engines and prepare to surrender or  we will d
CHAKOTAY: Initiating evasive pattern omega. Mark.
TUVOK: Shields at fifty percent.
CHAKOTAY: I need more power if we're going to make it to the Badlands.
TORRES: Take the weapons offline. We'll transfer all power to the  engines.
TUVOK: Considering the circumstances, I question that proposal at this  time.
TORRES: What does it matter? We're not making a dent in their shields  anyway! You wanted creative.
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, shut down all the phaser banks. If you can give me  another thirty seconds at full impulse, I'll get us into the Badlands.
TUVOK: Phasers offline.
CHAKOTAY: Throw the last photons at them and then give me the power  from the torpedo system.
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Firing photons.
CHAKOTAY: Are you reading any plasma storms ahead?
TUVOK: One. Co-ordinates one seven one, mark four three.
CHAKOTAY: That's where I'm going.
TUVOK: Plasma storm density increasing by fourteen percent. Twenty.  Twenty five.
CHAKOTAY: Hold on!
TUVOK: The Cardassian ship is not reducing power. They're following us  in.
CHAKOTAY: Gul Evek must feel daring today.
TUVOK: They've taken a hit on their port blade. They're sending out a  distress signal on all Cardassian frequencies.
CHAKOTAY: Can you plot a course through these plasma fields, Mister  Tuvok?
TUVOK: The storm's activity is typically widespread in this vicinity. I  can plot a course, but I'm afraid it will require an indirect route.
CHAKOTAY: We can use a time to make some repairs. What was that?
TUVOK: Curious. We've just passed through some kind of coherent tetryon  beam.
CHAKOTAY: Source?
TUVOK: Unknown. Now there appears to be a massive displacement wave  moving toward us.
CHAKOTAY: Another storm?
TUVOK: It's not a plasma phenomenon. At current speeds, it will  intercept us in less than thirty seconds.
CHAKOTAY: Anything left in those impulse generators, B'Elanna?
TORRES: We'll find out.
TUVOK: Still exceeding our speed.
CHAKOTAY: Maximum power.
TUVOK: Wave is continuing to accelerate. It will intercept us in eight  seconds. Five.
JANEWAY: Tom Paris? Kathryn Janeway. I served with your father on the  Al-Batani. I wonder if we could go somewhere and talk.
PARIS: About what?
JANEWAY: About a job we'd like you to do for us.
PARIS: I'm already doing a job for the Federation.
JANEWAY: I've been told the Rehab Commission is very pleased with your  work. They've given me their approval to discuss this matter with you.
PARIS: Well then, I guess I'm yours.
JANEWAY: Your father taught me a great deal. I was his science officer  during the Orias expedition.
PARIS: You must be good. My father only accepts the best and the  brightest.
JANEWAY: I'm leaving on a mission to find a Maquis ship that  disappeared in the Badlands a week ago.
PARIS: I wouldn't if I were you.
JANEWAY: Really?
PARIS: I've never seen a Federation starship that could manoeuvre  through the plasma storms.
JANEWAY: You've never seen Voyager. We'd like you to come along.
PARIS: You'd like me to lead you to my former colleagues. I was only  with the Maquis a few weeks before I was captured, Captain. I don't  know where most of their hiding places are.
JANEWAY: You know the territory better than anyone we've got.
PARIS: What's so important about this particular Maquis ship?
JANEWAY: My Chief of Security was on board, undercover. He was supposed  to report in twice during the last six days. He didn't.
PARIS: Maybe it's just your Chief of Security who's disappeared.
JANEWAY: Maybe. That ship was under the command of another former  Starfleet officer, named Chakotay. I understand you knew him.
PARIS: That's right.
JANEWAY: The two of you didn't get along too well, I'm told.
PARIS: Chakotay will tell you he left Starfleet on principle, to defend  his home colony from the Cardassians. I, on the other hand, was forced  to resign. He considered me a mercenary, willing to fight for anyone  who'd pay my bar bill. Trouble is, he was right. I have no problem  helping you track down my friends in the Maquis, Captain. All I need to  know from you is what's in it for me.
JANEWAY: You help us find that ship, we help you at your next outmeet  review.
PARIS: Ah ha.
JANEWAY: Officially, you'd be a Starfleet observer during the mission.
PARIS: Observer? Oh hell, I'm the best pilot you could have.
JANEWAY: You'll be an observer. When it's over, you're cut loose.
PARIS: The story of my life.
PARIS: Stadi, you're changing my mind about Betazoids.
STADI: Good.
PARIS: Oh, that wasn't a compliment. Until today I always considered  your people warm and sensual.
STADI: I can be warm and sensual.
PARIS: Just not to me.
STADI: Do you always fly at women at warp speed, Mister Paris?
PARIS: Only when they're in visual range.
STADI: That's our ship. That's Voyager.
STADI: Intrepid class. Sustainable cruise velocity of warp factor nine  point nine seven five. Fifteen decks. Crew complement of one hundred  and forty one. Bio-neural circuitry.
PARIS: Bio-neural?
STADI: Some of the traditional circuitry has been replaced by gel packs  that contain bio-neural cells. They organise information more  efficiently, speed up response time.
QUARK: If I may say so, it's been my special pleasure to see many new  officers like yourself come through these portals. Your parents must be  very proud, my boy. You know, on an occasion like this
KIM: I'm really not interested.
QUARK: Interested?
KIM: You were about to try to sell me something, right?
QUARK: I was merely going to suggest that your parents might appreciate  a memento of your first mission.
KIM: And you happen to have several to choose from?
QUARK: I do carry a select line of unique artefacts and gem stones  indigenous to this region. Why, quite recently, I acquired these Lobi  crystals from a very strange creature called a Morn.
KIM: We were warned about the Ferengi at the Academy.
QUARK: Warned about Ferengi, were you?
KIM: That's right.
QUARK: Slurs about my people at Starfleet Academy.
KIM: What I meant was
QUARK: Here I am, trying to be a cordial host, knowing how much a young  officer's parents would appreciate a token of his love on the eve of a  dangerous mission, and what do I get for my trouble? Scurrilous  insults. Well, somebody's going to hear about this. What's your name,  son?
KIM: My name?
QUARK: You have one, I presume?
KIM: Kim, Harry Kim. But I
QUARK: And who was it at the Academy who warned you about Ferengi?
KIM: You know, I think a memento for my parents would be a great idea.
QUARK: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
KIM: Really. What are these? It would make a great pendant for my  mother.
QUARK: Or cufflinks for your father.
KIM: Cufflinks. Great idea.
QUARK: They're not for sale. Now, inform your commanding officer that  the Federation Council can expect an official query.
KIM: How much for the entire tray?
QUARK: Cash or credit?
PARIS:  Dazzling, aren't they? As bright as a Koladan  diamond.
QUARK: Brighter.
PARIS: Hard to believe you can find them on any planet in the system.
QUARK: That's an exaggeration.
PARIS: You know, there's a shop at the Volnar Colony that sells a dozen  assorted shapes for one Cardassian lek. How much are you selling these  for?
QUARK: We were just about to negotiate the price.
PARIS: Come on.
KIM: Thanks.
PARIS: Didn't they warn you about Ferengi at the Academy?
DOCTOR: Run a level three diagnostic, just to be sure. Can I help you?
PARIS: Tom Paris, reporting on board.
DOCTOR: Oh yes. The observer.
PARIS: That's me. As a matter of fact, I seem to be observing some kind  of problem right now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I was a surgeon at the hospital on Caldic Prime at the same  time you were stationed there. We never actually met. Your medical  records have arrived from your last posting, Mister Paris. Everything  seems to be in order. The Captain asked if you were on board. You  should check in with her.
KIM: Er, I haven't paid my respects to the Captain yet either.
DOCTOR: Well, Mister Kim, that would be a good thing for a new  operations officer to do.
KIM:  What was that all about?
PARIS: It's a long story, Harry, and I'm tired of telling it. I'm sure  someone around here will tell you before long.
MARK : The doctor called.
JANEWAY: And?
MARK : And I was right.
JANEWAY: She's pregnant?
MARK : The puppies are due in seven weeks.
JANEWAY: Oh, Mark. You've got to take her home with you.
MARK : With me? I just got the rugs cleaned.
JANEWAY: She's with child. I can't leave her in a kennel while I'm
MARK : Is this another 'love me, love my dog' demand?
JANEWAY: Yes.
MARK : How could I ever refuse you?
JANEWAY: Thanks, honey.
MARK : So, when are you leaving?
JANEWAY: As soon as I approve these systems status reports.
MARK : All right. Then I won't bother you anymore.
JANEWAY: Hey. You never bother me, except the way I love to be  bothered. Understand?
MARK : I'll remember that.
JANEWAY: See you in a few weeks. Oh, Mark, go by my house and pick up  the doggie bed. She'll be more comfortable.
MARK : I already did, an hour ago.
JANEWAY: Come in.
JANEWAY: Gentlemen, welcome aboard Voyager.
KIM: Thank you, sir.
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, at ease before you sprain something. Ensign,  despite Starfleet protocol, I don't like being addressed as sir.
KIM: I'm sorry, ma'am.
JANEWAY: Ma'am is acceptable in a crunch, but I prefer Captain. We're  getting ready to leave. Let me show you to the bridge.
JANEWAY: Did you have any problems getting here, Mister Paris?
PARIS: None at all, Captain.
JANEWAY: My first officer, Lieutenant Commander Cavit. Ensign Kim,  Mister Paris.
CAVIT:  Welcome aboard.
JANEWAY: Ensign Kim, this is your station. Would you like to take over?
KIM: Yes, ma'am.
JANEWAY: It's not crunch time yet, Mister Kim. I'll let you know when.
CAVIT: Lieutenant Stadi, lay in the course and clear our departure with  operations.
STADI: Course entered, Ops has cleared us.
CAVIT: Ready thrusters.
KIM: Thrusters ready.
CAVIT: Initiate launching sequence.
STADI: Sequence underway.
JANEWAY: Engage.
PARIS: Tomato soup.
COMPUTER: There are fourteen varieties of tomato soup available from  this replicator. With rice, with vegetables, Bolian style, with pasta,  with
PARIS: Plain.
COMPUTER: Specify hot or chilled.
PARIS: Hot. Hot, plain, tomato soup.
PARIS: There, you see? I told you it wouldn't take long.
KIM: Is it true?
PARIS: Was the accident my fault? Yes. Pilot error. But it took me a  while to admit it. Oh, fourteen varieties and they can't even get plain  tomato soup right.
KIM: They said you falsified reports.
PARIS: That's right.
KIM: Why?
PARIS: What's the difference? I lied.
KIM: But then you came forward and you admitted that it was your fault?
PARIS: I'll tell you the truth, Harry. All I had to do was keep my  mouth shut and I was home free. But I couldn't. The ghosts of those  three dead officers came to me in the middle of the night and taught me  the true meaning of Christmas. So I confessed. Worst mistake I ever  made but not my last. After they cashiered me out of Starfleet, I went  out looking for a fight and found the Maquis. And on my first  assignment, I was caught.
KIM: It must have been especially tough for you, being the son of an  admiral.
PARIS: Frankly, I think it was tougher on my father than it was on me.  Look, I know those guys told you to stay away from me. And you know  what? You ought to listen to them. I'm not exactly a good luck charm.
KIM: I don't need anyone to choose my friends for me.
JANEWAY : Janeway to Paris.
PARIS: Go ahead.
JANEWAY : Report to the Bridge. We're approaching the Badlands.
ROLLINS: Plasma storms were measured at levels three and four.
JANEWAY: The Cardassians gave us the last known heading of the Maquis  ship, and we have charts of the plasma storm activity the day it  disappeared. With a little help, we might be able to approximate its  course.
PARIS: I'd guess they were trying to get to one of the M-class  planetoids in the Terikof Belt.
CAVIT: That's beyond the Moriya system.
ROLLINS: The plasma storms would have forced them in this direction.
JANEWAY: Adjust our course to match.
CAVIT: Aye, Captain.
JANEWAY: The Cardassians claimed they forced the Maquis ship into a  plasma storm where it was destroyed, but our probes haven't picked up  any debris.
PARIS: A plasma storm might not leave any debris.
JANEWAY: We'd still be able to pick up a resonance trace from the warp  core.
KIM: Captain, I'm reading a coherent tetryon beam scanning us.
JANEWAY: Origin, Mister Kim.
KIM: I'm not sure. There's also a displacement wave moving toward us.
JANEWAY: On screen.
JANEWAY: Analysis.
KIM: It's some kind of polarised magnetic variation.
CAVIT: We might be able to disperse it with a graviton particle field.
JANEWAY: Do it. Red alert. Move us away from it, Lieutenant.
STADI: New heading, four one mark one eight zero.
CAVIT: Initiating graviton field.
KIM: The graviton field had no effect.
JANEWAY: Full impulse.
KIM: The wave will intercept us in twelve seconds.
JANEWAY: Can we go to warp?
STADI: Not until we clear the plasma field, Captain.
KIM: Five seconds.
JANEWAY: Brace for impact.
KIM: Three.
JANEWAY: Report!
KIM: Hull breach, deck fourteen. Comm. lines to Engineering are down.  Trying to re-establish.
JANEWAY: Repair crews, seal off hull breach on deck fourteen.
CREWWOMAN : Aye, Captain.
ROLLINS: Casualty reports coming in. Sickbay is not responding.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Sickbay. Doctor, can you hear me? Paris, how's Stadi?
PARIS: She's dead.
KIM: Captain, there's something out there.
JANEWAY: I need a better description than that, Mister Kim.
KIM: I don't know. I'm reading. I'm not sure what I'm reading.
JANEWAY: Can you get the viewscreen operational?
KIM: I'm trying.
KIM: Captain, if these sensors are working, we're over seventy thousand  light years from where we were. We're on the other side of the galaxy.
KIM: I'm not reading any life signs on the Maquis ship.
JANEWAY: What about on that, that array?
KIM: Our sensors can't penetrate it.
JANEWAY: Any idea what those pulses are that are coming from it, Mister  Kim?
KIM: Massive bursts of radiant energy. They seem to be directed toward  a nearby G-type star system.
JANEWAY: Try hailing the array.
CAREY : Engineering to Bridge. We have some severe damage. The  Chief's dead. Possibility of a warp core breach.
JANEWAY: Secure all engineering systems. I'm on my way.
KIM: No response from the array.
JANEWAY: Ensign, get down to Sickbay. See what's going on. Mister  Rollins, the Bridge is yours.
ROLLINS: Aye, Captain.
PARIS: Harry, wait for me.
PARIS: They must have been right next to the console when it exploded.
COMPUTER: Warning. Warp core microfracture. Breach imminent.
JANEWAY: What's the warp core pressure?
CAREY: Twenty one hundred kilopascals.
JANEWAY: Lock down the magnetic constrictors.
CAREY: If we lock them down at these pressure levels, we might not be  able to reinitialise the dilithium reaction.
COMPUTER: Warning. Warp core microfracture. Breach imminent.
JANEWAY: We don't have a choice. We've got to get the reaction rate  down before we try to seal it.
KIM:  Computer, initiate Emergency Medical Holographic programme.
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
KIM: Multiple percussive injuries.
EMH: Status of your doctor?
KIM: He's dead.
EMH: Point four cc's of trianoline.
KIM: Trianoline?
PARIS: We lost our nurse too.
EMH: How soon are replacement medical personnel expected?
KIM: That could be a problem. We're pretty far away from replacements  right now.
EMH: Tricorder. Medical tricorder. A replacement must be requested as  soon as possible. I am programmed only as a short-term emergency  supplement to the medical team.
PARIS: Well, we may be stuck with you for a while, Doc.
EMH: There's no need for concern. I am capable of treating any injury  or disease. No concussion. You'll be fine. Clean him up.
JANEWAY: Unlock the magnetic constrictors.
CAREY: Constrictors online.
JANEWAY: Pressure?
CAREY: It's working. Twenty five hundred kilopascals and holding.
ROLLINS : Bridge to Janeway. We're being scanned by the array,  Captain. It's penetrated our shields.
JANEWAY: What kind of scan? Bridge? Janeway to Bridge, respond.
JANEWAY: Initiate emergency lock-off.
EMH: You're not seriously hurt. You can return to your station.
EMH: This is the Emergency Holographic Doctor speaking. I gave no  permission for anyone to be transported out of Sickbay. Hello? Sickbay  to Bridge. I believe someone has failed to terminate my programme.  Please respond.
AUNT ADAH: Come up here. Come on, now. I have a pitcher of lemonade and  some sugar cookies.
PARIS: Captain?
JANEWAY: Don't believe your eyes, Mister Paris. We've only transported  a hundred kilometres. We're inside the array.
KIM: There's no indication of stable matter. All this must be some kind  of holographic projection.
AUNT ADAH: Oh, you poor things. You must be tired out. Come on and sit  down and rest awhile. Have a cold drink, hmm?
JANEWAY: No, thank you. My name is Kathryn Janeway, captain of the  Federation Starship Voyager.
AUNT ADAH: Now, just make yourselves right at home. The neighbours  should be here any minute. Oh! Why, here they are!
CARETAKER:  Well, good to see you. Welcome.
DAUGHTER: We're real glad you dropped by.
AUNT ADAH: Now we can get started. You're all invited to the welcoming  bee!
CARETAKER: Let's have some music!
PARIS: The crew's scattered around this farm, Captain, but they're all  accounted for.
JANEWAY: Move around. Scan the area. See if you can find anything that  might be a holographic generator.
AUNT ADAH: Have some nice fresh corn on the cob. Fresh corn on the cob.  Corn on the cob. Corn on the cob.
JANEWAY: Can you tell me why we're here?
AUNT ADAH: Oh, we don't mean you any harm. I'm sorry if we put you out.  Why don't you just put your feet up and get comfortable while you wait?
JANEWAY: Wait for what?
AUNT ADAH: Isn't anybody hungry? Come on now, make yourselves at home.  I'm sorry if we put you out.
DAUGHTER: Hey, let me show you around. The root cellar's right over  there.
KIM: What's down there?
DAUGHTER: Potatoes, onions. But it's real private.
KIM: Paris, she's only a hologram.
PARIS: No reason to be rude.
KIM: Whoa.
PARIS: What?
KIM: Sporocystian life signs. What's in the barn?
DAUGHTER: Oh, nothing but a big old pile of hay. Hey, come on, let's go  see the duck pond. There's nothing in there. It's just a dark, smelly  barn. Hey, do y'all want some devilled eggs? Huh?
DAUGHTER: See? Nothing but hay.
KIM: There is a life form here. Just one.
PARIS: Where?
KIM: It's everywhere. I'm also reading some kind of matrix-processing  device. It may be the holographic generator. Paris, humanoid life signs  over here. I'm reading a Vulcan and several humans.
DAUGHTER: I'm not ready for you yet!
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.
JANEWAY: Janeway here. Paris? Come on!
AUNT ADAH: Very well. Since no one seems to care for any corn, we'll  have to proceed ahead of schedule.
JANEWAY: Janeway to Bridge. Anybody there?
ROLLINS : Yes, Captain. We're here.
JANEWAY: How long were we over there?
ROLLINS: Almost three days.
JANEWAY : Three days?
ROLLINS: Captain, the Maquis ship is powering up its engines.
JANEWAY: Tractor them. All senior officers, report
JANEWAY  : To the Bridge immediately.
EMH: Excuse me. Could you explain what has transpired?
PARIS: Computer, locate Ensign Kim.
COMPUTER: Ensign Kim is not on board.
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.
JANEWAY : Go ahead.
PARIS  : Kim didn't come back with us. He must still be over there.
JANEWAY: Acknowledged. Computer, how many crewmen are unaccounted for?
COMPUTER: One. Ensign Harry Kim.
JANEWAY: Hail the Maquis. Commander Chakotay. My name is Captain  Kathryn Janeway.
CHAKOTAY : How do you know my name?
JANEWAY: We were on a mission to find you when we were brought here by  the array. One of our crewman is missing. Was he transported back to  your ship by accident?
CHAKOTAY : No. A member of our crew is missing too.  B'Elanna Torres, my engineer.
JANEWAY: Commander, you and I have the same problem. I think it makes  sense to try and solve it together, don't you?
CHAKOTAY : Three of us will transport to your ship.
ROLLINS: They're powering down their engines, dropping their shields.
ROLLINS: Watch out, Captain. They're armed.
JANEWAY: Put down your weapons. You won't need those here. It's good to  have you back, Mister Tuvok.
TUVOK: I must inform you that I was assigned to infiltrate your crew,  sir. I am Captain Janeway's Chief of Security.
CHAKOTAY: Were you going to deliver us into their waiting hands, Vulcan?
TUVOK: My mission was to accumulate information on Maquis activities,  and then deliver you into their waiting hands. That is correct.
CHAKOTAY: I see you had help.
PARIS: It's good to see you too, Chakotay.
CHAKOTAY: At least the Vulcan was doing his duty as a Starfleet  officer. But you, you betrayed us for what? Freedom from prison?  Latinum? What was your price this time?
JANEWAY: You are speaking to a member of my crew. I expect you to treat  him with the same respect as you would have me treat a member of yours.  Now, we have a lot to accomplish, and I suggest we all concentrate on  finding our people and getting ourselves back home.
TUVOK: Based on my initial reconnaissance, Captain, I am convinced we  are dealing with a single entity in the array. I would suggest he  scanned our computers in order to select a comfortable holographic  environment. In effect, a waiting room to pacify us prior to biometric  assessment.
PARIS: An examination?
TUVOK: It is the most logical explanation. Why else would he have  released us unharmed?
PARIS: Not all of us were.
JANEWAY: Break out the compression phaser rifles. Meet us in  Transporter Room two. We're going back. We'll divide into teams. Mister  Tuvok, while Chakotay and I are looking for Torres and Kim, your job is  to find out as much about this array as you can. It brought us here. We  have to assume it can send us home. Agreed?  Mister  Rollins, maintain Red alert. Keep us on constant transporter locks.
PARIS: Captain. I'd like to go with you.
JANEWAY: If this has something to do with what Chakotay said.
PARIS: It doesn't. I'd just, I'd hate to see anything happen to Harry.
JANEWAY: Come on.
TUVOK: There are no humanoid lifeforms indicated, Captain. Kim and  Torres are not within tricorder range. They may not be on the array.
CHAKOTAY: He can tell us where they are.
JANEWAY: Maintain your comm. link. I don't want to lose anyone else.
CARETAKER: Oh, why have you come back? You don't have what I need.
JANEWAY: I don't know what you need and frankly I don't care. I just  want our people back and I want us all to be sent home.
CARETAKER: Oh, well now. Aren't you contentious for a minor bipedal  species?
JANEWAY: This minor bipedal species doesn't take kindly to being  abducted.
CARETAKER: Oh, it was necessary.
CHAKOTAY: Where are our people?
CARETAKER: They are no longer here.
JANEWAY: What have you done to them?
CARETAKER: You don't have what I need. They might. No, you'll have to  leave them.
CHAKOTAY: We won't do that.
JANEWAY: We are their commanding officers. We are entrusted with their  safety. They are our responsibility. That may be a concept you don't  understand.
CARETAKER: Oh, no, I do understand, but I have no choice. There just is  not enough time left.
JANEWAY: Left for what?
CARETAKER: I must honour a debt that can never be repaid, but my search  has not been going well.
JANEWAY: Tell us what you're looking for. Maybe we can help you find it.
CARETAKER: You? I've searched the galaxy with methods beyond your  comprehension. No, there's nothing you can do.
JANEWAY: You've taken us seventy thousand light years from our home. We  have no way back unless you send us, and we won't leave without the  others.
CARETAKER: But sending you back is terribly complicated. Don't you  understand? I don't have time. Not enough time!
NURSE  : He's regaining consciousness.
OCAMPA DOCTOR : How do you feel?
KIM: What am I doing here? Where am I?
NURSE: Please don't try to move yet. You are very ill.
KIM: Ill? No, no. There's some mistake. I'm not
TORRES: No!
JANEWAY: Come in.
TUVOK: Captain, I've observed something peculiar about the pulses.  They're getting faster.
JANEWAY: Faster.
TUVOK: The interval between each pulse has decreased by point four  seven seconds since we arrived. I can offer no explanation.
JANEWAY: That's only one of the mysteries we're dealing with, Mister  Tuvok. Take a look at this.
JANEWAY: It's virtually a desert. Not one ocean, not one river. It has  all the basic characteristics of an M-class planet except there are no  nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere.
TUVOK: That would mean the planet is incapable of producing rain.
JANEWAY: I've studied thousands of M-class planets. I've never seen an  atmosphere without nucleogenics. There must have been some kind of  extraordinary environmental disaster. As soon as repairs are complete,  we'll set a course for the fifth planet.
TUVOK: Captain, you require sleep.
JANEWAY: Kim's mother called me just after he left her. Delightful  woman. He's her only son. He'd left his clarinet behind. She wanted to  know if she had time to send it. I had to tell her no. Did you know he  played clarinet in the Julliard Youth Symphony?
TUVOK: I did not have the opportunity to meet Mister Kim.
JANEWAY: I barely knew him. I never seem to have the chance to get to  know any of them. I have to, I have to take more time to do that. It's  a fine crew and I've got to get them home.
TUVOK: The crew will not benefit from the leadership of an exhausted  captain.
JANEWAY: You're right as usual. I've missed your counsel, Tuvok.
TUVOK: I am gratified that you came after me so I can offer it once  again.
JANEWAY: I spoke to your family before I left.
TUVOK: Are they well?
JANEWAY: Well, but worried about you.
TUVOK: That would not be an accurate perception, Captain. Vulcans do  not worry.
JANEWAY: They miss you.
TUVOK: As I do them.
JANEWAY: I'll get you back to them. That's a promise, Tuvok.
JANEWAY:  Hail them.
NEELIX : Whoever you are, I found this waste zone first.
JANEWAY: We're not interested in this debris, Mister
NEELIX : Neelix. And since you're not interested in my  debris, well, I'm delighted to know you.
JANEWAY: Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation starship Voyager.
NEELIX : A very impressive title. I have no idea what it  means, but it sounds very impressive.
JANEWAY: Do you know this area of space well, Mister Neelix?
NEELIX : I am famous for knowing it well. How may I be  of service?
JANEWAY: Do you know anything about the array that's sending energy  pulses to the fifth planet?
NEELIX : I know enough to stay as far away from it as  possible. Wait. Let me guess. You were whisked away from somewhere else  in the galaxy, and brought here against your will.
JANEWAY: Sounds as though you've heard this story before.
NEELIX : Sadly, yes. Thousands of times. Well, hundreds  of times. Maybe fifty times. But the Caretaker has been bringing ships  here for months now.
JANEWAY: The Caretaker?
NEELIX : That's what the Ocampa call him. They live on  the fifth planet. Did he kidnap members of your crew?
JANEWAY: As a matter of fact, he did.
NEELIX : It's not the first time.
JANEWAY: Do you know where he might have taken them?
NEELIX : Just that they're brought to the Ocampa.  Nothing more.
JANEWAY: We'd appreciate any help you could give us in finding these  Ocampa.
NEELIX : I really wish that I could help you, I do, but  as you can see, there's just there's so much debris for me to  investigate today. You'd be surprised the things of value some people  abandon.
JANEWAY: Of course, we'd want to compensate you for your trouble.
NEELIX : Well, there's really very little that you could  offer me. Unless.
JANEWAY: Yes?
NEELIX : Unless of course, you had water.
JANEWAY: If you help us find our missing crew members, you can have all  the water you want.
NEELIX : That sounds like a very reasonable arrangement.
JANEWAY: Good. We'll beam you over and tow your ship into our shuttle  bay. Mister Tuvok, go to Transporter Room two and meet our guest.
NEELIX : Beam?
JANEWAY: We have a technology which can take you instantly from your  ship to ours. It's quite harmless. May we?
TUVOK:  Energise.
NEELIX: Astonishing! You Federations are obviously an advanced culture.
TUVOK: The Federation is made up of many cultures. I am Vulcan.
NEELIX: Neelix. Good to meet you!
NEELIX: Interesting. What, what exactly, what exactly does all this,  all this do?
TUVOK: I assure you that everything in this room has a specific  function. However, it would take several hours to explain it all. I  suggest we proceed to your quarters. Perhaps you would care for a bath.
NEELIX: A what?
KIM: It's okay. It's okay.
TORRES: Who are you?
KIM: My name is Kim. Harry Kim. I'm an ensign on the Starship Voyager.  I was kidnapped from the array just like you were. I don't know where  we are.
TORRES: What was Starfleet doing at that array?
KIM: We were looking for you, actually. One minute we're in the  Badlands, the next
TORRES: You mean you were trying to capture us.
KIM: Yeah. Consider yourself captured. Oh, I know I have a phaser here  somewhere.
TORRES: I don't find this at all amusing, Starfleet.
KIM: There's no point. It's locked. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What's that  going to accomplish?
TORRES: What are they doing to us? What are these things growing on us?
KIM: Look, do you want them to sedate you again?
TORRES: You're right, Starfleet. It's the Klingon half of me. It's just  it's hard to control it sometimes.
KIM: What's your name, Maquis?
TORRES: B'Elanna. B'Elanna Torres.
OCAMPA DOCTOR: I hope you're feeling better. I know how frightening all  this must be for both of you. I've brought some clothes if you'd care  to change.
TORRES: Why are you holding us here?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: You are not prisoners. In fact, we consider you honoured  guests. The Caretaker has sent you to us. As long as you are not  violent, you are free to leave your quarters.
KIM: What's wrong with us? What are these things?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: We really don't know. You must be hungry. Would you care  to join me on the courtyard for a meal?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: Our food dispensers are right this way.
KIM: We're underground.
OCAMPA DOCTOR: Our society is subterranean. We've lived here for over  five hundred generations.
TORRES: But before that, you lived on the surface?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: Until the Warming began.
KIM: The Warming?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: When our surface turned into a desert and the Caretaker  came to protect us. Our ancient journals tell us he opened a deep chasm  in the ground and led our ancestors to this place. Since then he has  provided for all our needs. Please forgive them. They know you've come  from the Caretaker. None of us has ever seen him. This way, please.
TORRES: Does the Caretaker provide your meals too?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: In fact, he does. He designed and built this entire city  for us after the Warming. The food processors dispense nutritional  supplements every four point one intervals. It may not offer the exotic  tastes some of our younger people crave these days, but it meets our  needs.
KIM: Is this how the Caretaker communicates with you?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: He never communicates directly. We try to interpret his  wishes as best we can.
KIM: I'm curious to know how you've interpreted the Caretaker's reason  for sending us here.
OCAMPA DOCTOR: We believe he must have separated you from your own  species for their protection.
TORRES: Their protection?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: From your illness. Perhaps he's trying to prevent a  plague.
TORRES: We weren't sick until we met your Caretaker.
OCAMPA DOCTOR: From time to time, he asks us to care for people with  this disease. It's the least we can do.
TORRES: There have been others? Like us?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: Yes.
TORRES: Where are they?
OCAMPA DOCTOR: Your condition is serious. We don't know exactly how to  treat it. I'm afraid the others did not recover.
TUVOK: Sir.
NEELIX: Ah, Mister Vulcan. Come in, come in, please. I can hardly see  you.
NEELIX: I want to thank you for your hospitality. I must admit, I  haven't had access to a food rebel er, er, replicator before.
TUVOK: I'd never have guessed.
NEELIX: And to immerse myself in water. Oh, do you know what joy this  is? No one around here wastes water in this manner. Good sand scrub,  that's the best that we can hope for.
TUVOK: I am pleased you are enjoying yourself, but we are in orbit of  the fifth planet. We need your assistance.
NEELIX: Oh! Could you hand me the, er, towel?
NEELIX: If you will scan the large southern continent you'll find a  range of extinct volcanoes. Follow the foothills north until you  discover a dry riverbed. You'll find an encampment there.
TUVOK: Do you believe our people might be at this location?
NEELIX: It's not impossible. Maybe. Perhaps not. But we'll find them.  We'll need several containers of water to bring for barter. Do these,  er, replicators make clothing as well?
TUVOK: Yes.
NEELIX: Will it make me a uniform like yours?
TUVOK: No, it most certainly will not.
PARIS: Why would anyone want to live in a place like this?
NEELIX: The rich cormaline deposits are very much in demand.
CHAKOTAY: The Ocampa use it for barter?
NEELIX: Not the Ocampa, the Kazon-Ogla.
JANEWAY: The Kazon-Ogla? Who are the Kazon-Ogla?
NEELIX: They are. Kazon sects control this part of the quadrant. Some  have food, some have ore, some have water. They all trade and they all  kill each other for it.
JANEWAY: I thought you said the Ocampa had our people.
NEELIX: My friends, it's good to see you again!
NEELIX: I must speak with your Maje, the ever-wise Jabin!
NEELIX: Very amusing.
KAZON: Destroy him.
NEELIX: Very amusing. I, I enjoy a joke as much as the next man. Jabin!  My old friend! Water. Water, Jabin. I have water to replace all that I  borrowed. Show them, Mister Paris. Their ship has technology that makes  water out of thin air!
JABIN: You have more?
JANEWAY: Janeway to Voyager. Energise.
JANEWAY: There's more where that came from, if you can help us.
JABIN: How can we help someone so powerful they can create water out of  thin air?
JANEWAY: This man led us here suggesting we might find a people called  the Ocampa. Do you know where they are?
JABIN: Ocampa. She is Ocampa.
JABIN: Why would you be interested in such worthless creatures? They  live only nine years. They make poor servants. We caught her when she  wandered to the surface.
JANEWAY: To the surface? You mean they live underground?
JABIN: The entity in space that gives them food and power also gives  them sole access to the only water on this world, two miles below the  surface.
JANEWAY: This same entity has abducted two of our people. We believe  they might be with the Ocampa.
JABIN: There's no way to get to them. We tried. The entity has  established some kind of subterranean barrier we can not penetrate.
CHAKOTAY: But she got out.
JABIN: Occasionally, some of them do find their way to the surface. We  don't know how, but the Ocampa seal the tunnels afterwards.
NEELIX: Maybe she can help these good people find a way down.
JABIN: You'd be wasting your time. I've used every method of persuasion  I know to get her to help us. She won't.
NEELIX: Then she's worthless to you. Let us trade you water for this  scrawny little thing.
JABIN: I'd be more interested in acquiring this technology that allows  you to create water from thin air.
JANEWAY: That would be difficult. It's integrated into our ship's  systems.
NEELIX: Tell them to drop their weapons. Drop them, my friends, or he  dies in an instant.
JABIN: Do it. Do it!
NEELIX: Step aside.
NEELIX: Come on!
NEELIX: I strongly suggest you get us out of here.
JANEWAY: Six to beam up.
NEELIX:  My dearest. Didn't I promise I'd save you?
KIM: Look, I'm sure Captain Janeway is doing everything she can to find  us.
TORRES: What makes you think any of them are still alive?
KIM: Should I call for some help?
TORRES: No.
NURSE: Are you in pain?
TORRES: Are you watching us? I thought we weren't supposed to be your  prisoners.
NURSE: I wasn't watching you. I was coming to give you something. I  don't know if it'll help. It's a medicine. There are people who have  broken from tradition and left the city. Their colony grows fruits and  vegetables. They discovered quite by accident that the moss that grows  on certain fruit trees has healing properties. I'm sorry for what has  happened to you.
KIM: Appreciate this, but the only way we're going to survive is if we  can get to the surface and find our own people.
NURSE: The elders would say that's against the Caretaker's wishes.
TORRES: What do you say?
NURSE: The Caretaker's been behaving strangely for the past several  months. Abducting people, increasing the power supply.
KIM: Power supply.
NURSE: He's tripled the energy he sends us. They say we have enough  stored now to run the city for five years.
KIM: Nobody knows why?
NURSE: When we ask, we're told to trust the Caretaker's decisions. One  person I knew did get to the surface. We never saw her again.
KIM: How?
NURSE: The ancient tunnels that brought us here still exist. Over the  years, small breaches in security barriers have appeared just large  enough for someone to get through. But it still requires digging  through metres of rock to get out.
TORRES: Can you get us tools to dig with?
NURSE: It would take days, maybe even weeks to break through. You have  to rest. Conserve your strength.
KIM: Please. It's our only chance.
TUVOK: If you had told us what you had planned, we might have  anticipated your irrational behaviour.
NEELIX: Irrational? We got out of there, didn't we?
KES: Excuse me. Don't blame Neelix.
EMH: That's enough. This is a sickbay, not a conference room. Visiting  hours are over. Everyone except my patient is to leave immediately.
JANEWAY: Computer, end Medical Holographic Programme.
KES: I never should have gone to the surface. I'm too curious. I'm told  it's my worst failing.
NEELIX: No, no, it's a wonderful quality. Your most endearing.
JANEWAY: Would you be willing to take us underground to look for our  missing crew?
KES: I'm afraid Jabin was right. There's no way to get down. The tunnel  I came out has been sealed.
JANEWAY: We don't need a tunnel. We have the ability to transport there  directly.
TUVOK: Captain, our sensors did not pick up any indication of an  underground civilisation. The subterranean barrier Jabin described may  be responsible. It might also block our transporter.
KES: There are breaches in the security barrier where it's begun to  decay. That's how I got out.
JANEWAY: Have the transporter room begin a sweep for any breaches we  might be able to beam through.
NEELIX: Kes can tell you where to go. But now that she's free, we're  leaving this system together.
KES: Neelix, these people rescued me.
NEELIX: I rescued you.
KES: With their help. It would be wrong not to help them now.
TUVOK: Captain, the pulses from the array continue to accelerate. The  intervals between them have decreased another point eight seconds.
DAGGIN: Kes.
KES: Hello, Daggin.
DAGGIN: We thought we'd never see you again. How did you get back?
KES: These people rescued me from the Kazon. I'm trying to help them  find two of their crewmen. Does anyone know where the aliens are kept?  The ones the Caretaker sends here?
DAGGIN: I think they're at the central clinic.
JANEWAY: Can you take us there?
TOSCAT : No, she cannot.
KES: They can't speak telepathically, Toscat. Please talk aloud.
TOSCAT: I didn't meant to be rude but you should not be here.
JANEWAY: We'll be glad to leave once we find our crewmen.
TOSCAT: That won't be possible. We cannot interfere with the  Caretaker's wishes.
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you can't, but we can.
TOSCAT: You don't understand.
KES: That's right. They don't understand. They have no way of knowing  that the Ocampa have been dependent on the Caretaker for so long, we  can't even think for ourselves any more. They don't understand we were  once a people who had full command of our mind's abilities.
TOSCAT: The stories of our ancestor's cognitive abilities are  apocryphal. At the very least exaggerated.
KES: We lost those abilities because we stopped using them.
TOSCAT: We should not dwell on what's been lost but on all that's been  gained.
KES: We've gained a talent for dependence, for simply taking what we're  given. I'm going to help them, Toscat, whether you like it or not, and  I think my friends will join me.
TOSCAT: You defied the Caretaker by going to the surface, Kes. Learn  from the experience. Follow the path he has set for us.
KES: I've learned very well, Toscat. I saw the sunlight. I can't  believe that our Caretaker would forbid us to open our eyes and see the  sky. Come with me. We'll find your people.
TORRES: Come on. Don't let it beat you, Starfleet. Come on.
KIM: I'm sorry.
TORRES: All right. It's all right. We'll rest a minute.
KIM: Maybe I'd do better if I had a little Klingon blood in me.
TORRES: Trust me, it's more trouble than it's worth.
KIM: You know, I spent my whole life getting ready for Starfleet. And  on my very first mission, I'm going to die.
TORRES: We're not finished yet. I know a few things that old Sneezy  didn't teach in his survival course.
KIM: Sneezy?
TORRES: Commander Zakarian, remember? He must have been allergic to  everything.
KIM: You went to the Academy.
TORRES: Actually made it into the second year before we, er, we  mutually agreed that it wasn't the place for me.
KIM: You know, I never really liked Zakarian.
TORRES: Shush. Listen. They're getting faster.
JANEWAY: Away team to Voyager.
ROLLINS : Voyager here.
JANEWAY: What's going on with the array?
ROLLINS: It's no longer sending out pulses, Captain, and it appears to  be realigning its position.
JANEWAY : Keep me informed. Janeway out.
KES:  They haven't been at the clinic for hours.
DAGGIN: We can search the city. Ask if anyone's seen them.
JANEWAY: If they were trying to get to the surface, how would they go?
KES: Probably the same way I did. Up one of the ancient tunnels.
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, you and Neelix go with her and start checking  them out. We need to talk to every doctor and nurse at this hospital,  see what they can tell about Torres and Kim.
ROLLINS : Voyager to Janeway.
JANEWAY: Go ahead.
ROLLINS: Captain, the array is firing some kind of weapon at the  surface. It seems to be trying to seal the energy conduits.
JANEWAY : Understood. Keep a channel open.
CHAKOTAY: If the array is the Ocampa's sole source of energy, why would  the Caretaker seal the conduits?
TUVOK: He would seal them if he no longer intended to use them, to  protect the Ocampa from their enemies. Captain, there is now enough  evidence to form a reasonable hypothesis. I believe that the Caretaker  is dying.
JANEWAY: Explain.
TUVOK: First, he increases the energy supply to provide the city with a  surplus to last at least five years. Then he seals the conduits. The  logical conclusion is that he does not intend to continue his role as  Caretaker.
CHAKOTAY: That doesn't necessarily mean he's dying. He could be leaving.
TUVOK: Doubtful. Not after a millennium of providing for these people.  I believe that the Caretaker owes something to the Ocampa. I believe  the debt that can never repaid is very likely a debt to them. In  addition, there were his frequent references to running out of time. I  think he knew his death was imminent.
JANEWAY: If he dies, how the hell are we supposed to get home?
PARIS: They're in this one. Harry! Paris to Janeway.
JANEWAY : Go ahead.
PARIS: They're in one of the tunnels, Captain. I can't see them, but  they're up there. We're going after them.
JANEWAY: Call for transport when you have them, Paris. We'll meet you  on the ship. Janeway to Voyager.
ROLLINS : Voyager here.
JANEWAY: Three to beam up.
ROLLINS : Stand by.
ROLLINS: Captain, I can't get a lock on you.
ROLLINS  : The weapons fire from the array has irradiated the planet's  crust.
ROLLINS: The transport sensors can't find the breaches in the security  barrier.
JANEWAY: Come on. There's only one other way out of here.
JANEWAY  : Janeway to Paris.
PARIS: Go ahead.
JANEWAY : The transporters aren't working. You're going to have to  find a breach in the security barrier when you get to the top.
PARIS: Understood.
JANEWAY : We're a few minutes behind you. Janeway out.
PARIS: I see them.
KIM: Took you long enough.
PARIS: How could I let down the only friend I've got?
KIM: Friend? What makes you think I'm your friend?
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.
JANEWAY : Go ahead.
PARIS: We found them, Captain.
JANEWAY:  Don't wait for us. Get them to  safety.
KES:  Don't worry. I know we can get through the  barrier.
KES: Whatever you do, don't touch it. We've been told it'll burn your  skin off.
JANEWAY: They're not far ahead of us. Keep going.
PARIS:  I think we've reached the top. Neelix, get out your phaser.
PARIS: Voyager, can you get a lock on us now?
ROLLINS : Affirmative. But I'm reading only five signals.
PARIS: The others are. Get down!
PARIS: Paris to Janeway. Chakotay, Tuvok, do you read? Voyager, prepare  to transport everyone in this group except me.
ROLLINS : Aye, sir.
NEELIX: You're not thinking of going back there? Well, if a fool needs  company. Take care of them, dearest. I'll see you later.
PARIS: Voyager, make that three to beam up. Lock in on the other comm.  badge and energise.
CHAKOTAY: My leg is broken. I can't move.
JANEWAY: Hold on.
NEELIX: There they are.
JANEWAY: Neelix, help me with Tuvok.
PARIS: I'll get Chakotay.
CHAKOTAY: Get out of here, Paris, before the whole thing comes down!
PARIS: I intend to, as soon as I get you up.
CHAKOTAY: You get on those stairs, they'll collapse! We'll both die!
PARIS: Yeah? But on the other hand, if I save your butt your life  belongs to me. Isn't that some kind of Indian custom?
CHAKOTAY: Wrong tribe.
PARIS: I don't believe you.
PARIS: You'd rather die than let me be the one to rescue you?
CHAKOTAY: Fine. Be a fool. If I have to die, at least I'll have the  pleasure of watching you go with me.
PARIS: Isn't there some Indian trick where you can turn yourself into a  bird and fly us out of here?
CHAKOTAY: You're too heavy.
ROLLINS : Bridge to Janeway.
JANEWAY: Go ahead.
ROLLINS : Captain, two Kazon ships are approaching the Array.
JANEWAY: Set a course. I'm on my way.
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get back to our ship.
EMH: I strongly advise you to rest. I will not be held responsible for  the consequences. Is the crew always this difficult?
KIM: I don't know, Doc. It's my first mission.
EMH: Doesn't anyone know how to turn off the programme when they leave?
JANEWAY: Bring the weapons systems online.
TUVOK: Powering up phase banks and photon systems.
JANEWAY: Red alert.
TUVOK: The lead Kazon ship is hailing us, Captain.
JANEWAY: On screen.
JABIN : Have you come to investigate the entity's  strange behaviour too, Captain?
JANEWAY: All we care about is getting home, Jabin. We're about to  transport over to the Array to see if we can arrange it.
JABIN : I'm afraid I can not permit that.
JANEWAY: We have no dispute with you.
JABIN : I have a dispute with anyone who would challenge  us.
JANEWAY: This is ridiculous. We have no intention of challenging you.
JABIN : And I have no intention of letting anyone with  your technological knowledge board the Array.
JANEWAY: Jabin, can we discuss this like two civilised
TUVOK: They're powering up their weapons.
JANEWAY: I guess we can't.
TUVOK: Shields are holding.
JANEWAY: Fire phasers. Evasive pattern, delta four.
JANEWAY  : Janeway to Chakotay. Tuvok and I are beaming to the Array. Can  you hold off the Kazon?
CHAKOTAY: I think so, Captain.
JANEWAY: Good. Mister Paris, take the conn.
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.
JANEWAY: Maintain transporter locks, Ensign. Emergency beam out status.
KIM: Aye, Captain.
TUVOK: The data processing system is behind this wall, Captain.
JANEWAY: You know what to do.
CARETAKER: Well, you're nothing if not persistent.
JANEWAY: We need you to send us back where we came from.
CARETAKER: That isn't possible. I've barely enough strength to complete  my work.
JANEWAY: You're sealing the conduits before you die.
CARETAKER: If I don't, the Kazon will steal the water. But in a few  years, when the Ocampa's energy runs out, it won't matter. They'll be  forced to come to the surface and they won't be able to survive.
JANEWAY: Something you did turned their planet into a desert, didn't  it? That was the debt that could never be repaid.
CARETAKER: We're explorers from another galaxy. We had no idea that our  technology would be so destructive to their atmosphere. Two of us were  chosen to stay behind and care for them.
JANEWAY: There's another like you here?
CARETAKER: Not anymore. No, no. She went off to look for more  interesting places.
JANEWAY: Why were you bringing ships here, infecting people with a  fatal illness?
CARETAKER: Oh, they didn't die of an illness. They died because they  were incompatible.
JANEWAY: Incompatible?
CARETAKER: I've been searching the galaxy for a compatible biomolecular  pattern. Now, in some individuals I found cellular structures that were  similar, but I
JANEWAY: You've been trying to procreate?
CARETAKER: I needed someone to replace me. Someone who'd understand the  enormous responsibility of caring for the Ocampa. Only my offspring  could do that.
JANEWAY: Did you ever consider allowing the Ocampa to care for  themselves?
CARETAKER: They're children.
JANEWAY: Children have to grow up. We're explorers too. Most of the  species we've encountered have overcome all kinds of adversity without  a Caretaker. It's the challenge of surviving on their own that helps  them to evolve. Maybe your children will do better than you think.
KIM : Voyager to Janeway.
JANEWAY: Go ahead.
KIM : We've got problems here.
KIM: The Kazon just got some back up.
JANEWAY : We need more time.
JANEWAY: Can you hold them off for another few minutes?
KIM : We'll do our best. Kim out.
CHAKOTAY: Their weapons array has been hit. They're in trouble.
TORRES: Neither of us has enough fire power to stop that ship.
CHAKOTAY: I'm setting a collision course, but the guidance system is  disabled. I'll have to pilot the ship manually. Get the crew ready to  beam to Voyager. And drop shields for transport. Paris, my crew's  coming over. Tell one of your crackerjack Starfleet transporter chiefs  to keep a lock on me. I'm going to try and take some heat off your tail.
PARIS : Acknowledged.
PARIS:  But don't for one second think this makes us even, Chakotay. Your life  is still mine.
PARIS  : Paris out.
ROLLINS: I'm holding the lock on him, sir, but he's getting too close.
PARIS: I'm getting you out of there, Chakotay.
CHAKOTAY : Not yet!
PARIS : You're breaking up. Stand by to transport.
CHAKOTAY: Wait.
CHAKOTAY: Now!
PARIS  : Transporter Room two, do you have him?
CHAKOTAY: They've got me.
TUVOK:  Captain, I can access the system to send us back to Federation space,  but it will take several hours to activate.
JANEWAY: Unless you help us.
CARETAKER: Oh, I wish I could but I have very little time left, so I  have initiated a self-destruct programme.
JANEWAY: If you destroy the Array, we'll have no way to get home.
CARETAKER: The Ocampa's enemies can not be allowed to control this  installation. In minutes, it'll be destroyed. You have to go. Go now.
TUVOK: The Caretaker?
JANEWAY: Voyager, report.
PARIS : Kazon vessel
PARIS:  Just collided with the array, Captain. Are you all right?
JANEWAY : Affirmative.
JANEWAY: Stand by.
CARETAKER: The self-destruct programme has been damaged. Now this  installation will not be destroyed. But it must be. The Kazon must not  be allowed to gain control of it. They will annihilate the Ocampa.
TUVOK: Shall I activate the programme to get us back?
JANEWAY: And what happens to the Ocampa after we're gone?
TUVOK: Captain, any action we take to protect the Ocampa would affect  the balance of power in this system. The Prime Directive would seem to  apply.
JANEWAY: Would it? We never asked to be involved, Tuvok, but we are. We  are.
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, ready the tricobalt devices.
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.
JANEWAY: Open a channel to the Kazon.
KIM: Channel open.
JABIN : Be advised, Captain. I have called for  additional ships.
JANEWAY: I'm calling to warn you to move your vessels to a safe  distance. I intend to destroy the Array.
JABIN : You can't do that!
JANEWAY: I can and I will. End transmission.
KIM: They're increasing fire, Captain. Shields are holding.
JANEWAY: Move us four hundred kilometres from the Array, Mister Paris.
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.
TORRES: What do you think you're doing? That Array is the only way we  have to get back home.
JANEWAY: I'm aware everyone has families and loved ones at homes they  want to get back to. So do I. But I'm not willing to trade the lives of  the Ocampa for our convenience. We'll have to find another way home.
TORRES: What other way home is there? Who is she to be making these  decisions for all of us?
CHAKOTAY: She's the Captain.
TUVOK: The tricobalt devices are ready.
PARIS: We're in position.
JANEWAY: Fire.
KIM: The lead Kazon ship is hailing us.
JANEWAY: On screen.
JABIN : You have made an enemy today.
TUVOK: They are withdrawing, Captain.
JANEWAY: Come in.
PARIS: You asked to see me, Captain.
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, you have a problem. I've invited Chakotay and  the other Maquis to become part of this crew. It seemed the only  reasonable thing to do under the circumstances.
PARIS: Will you provide a bodyguard for me, Captain?
JANEWAY: It seems you already have one.
PARIS: I do?
JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay said something about his life belonging to  you? He'll be taking responsibility for your safety.
PARIS: I think I'm going to enjoy this.
JANEWAY: Don't be so sure. He'll also be my First Officer. Everyone  aboard this ship will report to him, including the lieutenant assigned  to conn.
PARIS: Me?
JANEWAY: I've entered into the ship's log on this date that I'm  granting a field commission of lieutenant to Thomas Eugene Paris.  Congratulations.
PARIS: Er, for the first time in my life I don't know what to say.
JANEWAY: You've earned this, Tom. I'm only sorry your father won't know.
PARIS: Oh, he'll know. When we get back.
NEELIX: Ah, Captain! We were just coming to see you.
JANEWAY: We supplied your ship with water, Neelix. It's ready to go.
NEELIX: Well, you see, that's what we wanted to discuss. We'd like to  go with you.
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. This isn't a passenger ship.
KES: Of course not. We won't be passengers.
NEELIX: We'd be valuable colleagues.
JANEWAY: Colleagues?
NEELIX: Whatever you need is what I have to offer. You need a guide?  I'm your guide. You need supplies? I know where to procure them. I have  friends among races you don't even know exist. You need a cook? Oh, you  haven't lived until you've tasted my angla'bosque. It will be my job to  anticipate your needs before you know you have them. And I anticipate  your first need will be me.
KES: Captain, we both want very much to be a part of your journey.
JANEWAY: We're alone in an uncharted part of the galaxy. We have  already made some friends here, and some enemies. We have no idea of  the dangers we're going to face, but one thing is clear. Both crews are  going to have to work together if we're to survive. That's why  Commander Chakotay and I have agreed that this should be one crew. A  Starfleet crew. And as the only Starfleet vessel assigned to the Delta  Quadrant, we'll continue to follow our directive to seek out new worlds  and explore space. But our primary goal is clear. Even at maximum  speeds, it would take seventy five years to reach the Federation, but  I'm not willing to settle for that. There's another entity like the  Caretaker out there somewhere who has the ability to get us there a lot  faster. We'll be looking for her, and we'll be looking for wormholes,  spatial rifts, or new technologies to help us. Somewhere along this  journey, we'll find a way back. Mister Paris, set a course for home.
PARIS: Aye, Captain.
