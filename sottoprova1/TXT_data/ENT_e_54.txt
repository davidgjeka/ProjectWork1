HUMANOID: How much of the lab was destroyed?
DEGRA: Nearly all of it. Three of my researchers were killed.
REPTILIAN: And what of your work, Degra?
DEGRA: I haven't been able to assess how much data was lost. This will  obviously delay us.
INSECTOID: How long?
DEGRA: Months perhaps. I'm not certain.
INSECTOID: The humans have been through our space!
REPTILIAN: They attacked a trellium mine. We cannot wait any longer.
DEGRA: Think what you're asking me to do. Build a weapon to destroy an  entire world. Do you understand how difficult, how dangerous this  project is?
REPTILIAN: Are you saying you're not up to the task?
AQUATIC: Dissension will solve nothing. We knew there could be  setbacks.
ARBOREAL: I agree. We are too far along to change our plan.
HUMANOID: Besides, we have no alternative.
REPTILIAN: You know that isn't true.
HUMANOID: That option has been discussed and rejected.
INSECTOID: Not by all of us.
REPTILIAN: Perhaps it is time to reconsider our colleagues' proposal.
HUMANOID: We do not have enough information about the humans!
REPTILIAN: That can be remedied.
AQUATIC: It's too dangerous.
ARBOREAL: I agree. Degra deserves more time.
AQUATIC: But if we do not see some progress soon, we'll have no choice  but to consider all our options.
T'POL: Is that  sufficient pressure?
TUCKER: You could go a little harder. Mmm, perfect. Try that neck  thing. What'd you call it?
T'POL: The Khavorta posture?
TUCKER: Yeah, that one.
T'POL: Are you certain?
TUCKER: Don't worry, I've been practicing my breathing.
T'POL: You have been practicing.
TUCKER: T'Pol.
T'POL: Don't speak. Relax your jaw. Excellent. Now, the surah'than.
TUCKER: You know, I really need to talk to you about something.
T'POL: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: No. No, no, I mean, this feels great, and I really appreciate  you taking the time. It's just, I'm not sure we should be doing it  anymore.
T'POL: You said this was helping you sleep.
TUCKER: It has.
T'POL: Then why do you want to stop?
TUCKER: People are talking. About us. About me coming to your quarters  at night. They think there's more going on than neuro-pressure.
T'POL: And that disturbs you.
TUCKER: It shouldn't, I know, but Malcolm and I were purging a clogged  injector assembly only last week and he asked me why I didn't just  massage it with my magic fingers.
T'POL: I see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip.
TUCKER: It doesn't bother you?
T'POL: We're both senior officers. If we were pursuing a romantic  relationship it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern, would it?
TUCKER: I suppose not.
T'POL: Shall we continue?
PHLOX: You've been scratching again.
ARCHER: The itching kept me up all night.
PHLOX: Have you been using the ointment I gave you?
ARCHER: I tried, but the smell is a little strong.
PHLOX: The more you scratch, the longer it will take to heal. I  understand you may have found a source of trellium-D?
ARCHER: A V'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he  knows a way to synthesis it.
PHLOX: I hope he's correct. Crewman Cutler broke her arm when one of  those spatial anomalies went through the Exo-biology lab. The sooner  the ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier I will be.
ARCHER: We're working on it, Doctor.
PHLOX: Of course.
PHLOX: Have you had any other symptoms?
ARCHER: Just dreams. I keep seeing myself back at that alien city.
PHLOX: You were transformed into a different species. Don't expect to  recover overnight.
ARCHER: The chemist said his shop was on barge twelve.
TUCKER: Phlox would have a field day here.
ARCHER: I'm afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for another  time.
ALIEN: I don't recognise your species. You  must be newcomers. Welcome.
ARCHER: Thank you. We're looking for barge twelve, a chemist named  B'Rat Ud.
ALIEN: It would be a shame if I let you leave our world without  introducing you to the local wildlife.
ARCHER: That's not necessary.
ALIEN: Zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh is quite  succulent when prepared properly.
ARCHER: No, thank you. Can you direct us to the chemist?
ALIEN: Barge twelve is that way. Tier two.
B'RAT UD:  I'm closed.
ARCHER: I have an appointment. We met at the deuterium station on  Norellus.
B'RAT UD: You'll have to come back later.
ARCHER: You said you could sell us the formula to synthesise  trellium-D. I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing.
B'RAT UD: Captain Archer? I remember now. How are you?
ARCHER: A little pressed for time.
B'RAT UD: Of course. Trellium-A is extremely common, easy to  synthesise, but trellium-D is rare, difficult to process.
TUCKER: And expensive?
B'RAT UD: I'm confident we can agree on a fair price. I was thinking  about you recently, Captain. You were very eager to learn about the  Xindi, as I recall. What is your interest in them?
ARCHER: We're on a diplomatic mission.
B'RAT UD: A diplomatic mission. Some Xindi arrived here last week. I  thought you might be interested.
REED: Where can we find them?
B'RAT UD: They had business with another merchant.
ARCHER: Who?
B'RAT UD: I'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee.
ARCHER: Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd be  willing to barter. As a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell me  where we can find this merchant, then you and Mister Tucker can work  out the details.
TUCKER: I'm confident we can agree on a fair price.
MISTRESS: Do you like what you see?
ZJOD:  To answer your first  question, I regret I cannot offer free samples.
ARCHER: B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us.
ZJOD: I always welcome referrals. What is your pleasure?
ARCHER: We were told you've recently done business with some Xindi.
ZJOD: Excellent customers. They purchased two U'tani serpent women. I'm  afraid I don't have any more, but perhaps I could interest you in a  Nuvian concubine? She's quite skilled.
ARCHER: We're not interested. I want to know where we can find these  Xindi.
ZJOD: I believe they left orbit two days ago.
ARCHER: Where were they heading?
ZJOD: I wouldn't stay in business very long if I revealed confidential  information about my clients, but I have females here from many worlds.  Who knows, perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about  the Xindi.
ZJOD: You have an excellent eye, my friend. She can be very  accommodating.
ARCHER:  Archer.
TUCKER : Captain, B'Rat and I have agreed on a price. I'll need to  go back to the ship for his payment.
ARCHER: Understood. We'll meet you back at the shuttlepod.
ZJOD: How can you walk away from such beauty?
ARCHER: Thanks for your time.
REED: After an hour in this place, I can't wait to get back to Decon.
ZJOD : Stop her!
RAJIIN: Take me  with you, please.
ZJOD: She seems determined to be sold today. Let's go back to my shop  and arrange for payment.
ARCHER: I don't think so.
ZJOD: Then I'll take my merchandise.
ARCHER: Looks like she doesn't want to go with you.
ZJOD: If you're so concerned about what she wants, buy her. Otherwise,  stay out of this.
ARCHER: Let's get out of here!
REED: Gladly.
PHLOX: You have the most intriguing eyes. I've  never seen a retinal structure this complex.
ARCHER: How's our guest?
PHLOX: I'm not familiar with her species, but she appears to be in  perfect health.
ARCHER: I'm afraid I don't even know your name.
RAJIIN: I'm called Rajiin. I'm very grateful for what you've done,  Captain. I'll serve you well, I promise.
ARCHER: Let's get something straight. We don't believe one person can  own another person. You're free to go wherever you'd like. How far is  your home world?
RAJIIN: I don't know. I'm told it's called Oran'taku, but I don't  remember it.
ARCHER: Do you have any family?
RAJIIN: I've had many owners.
ARCHER: We have some data on this region of space. I'll see if I can  locate Oran'taku. If it's possible, we'll take you there.   Set her up in quarters, get her whatever she needs.
PHLOX: Of course.
RAJIIN: Captain? Thank you.
TUCKER: On our planet, wars were fought over these. Careful.
B'RAT UD: What's this one called?
TUCKER: Black pepper. There's paprika, mustard seed. I'm partial to the  cayenne myself. I'm sure you'll find these all very exotic.
REED: I believe you have something for us?
B'RAT UD: Of course. I've reviewed your engineering specifications. You  appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-D.
REED: Liquid?
B'RAT UD: Trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. It's just  as effective as the natural ore.
TUCKER: Then all we need is the recipe.
B'RAT UD: There is one thing. Be sure to follow the protocols  precisely.
TUCKER: Or?
B'RAT UD: Let's just say that in it's liquid form, trellium-D is  extremely unstable.
ARCHER: How are your accommodations?
RAJIIN: Much better than I'm used to. The last ship I was on, I never  left the cargo hold. Except for a few visits to the Captain's quarters.
ARCHER: There are some restricted areas on Enterprise, otherwise feel  free to look around.
RAJIIN: Your crew won't mind?
ARCHER: I seriously doubt it.
RAJIIN: Are they all from Earth?
ARCHER: Nearly all. You've met Doctor Phlox, he's from Denobula. My  first officer's a Vulcan.
RAJIIN: Doctor Phlox mentioned you were on an important mission.
ARCHER: We're trying to make contact with a species called Xindi. I  don't suppose you know anything about them?
RAJIIN: Very little. The two I saw looked reptilian, and they weren't  very pleasant. At the time, I was just relieved they weren't interested  in me. Why are you looking for them?
ARCHER: We're hoping to resolve a disagreement.
TUCKER : Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
TUCKER : We're in business, sir.
ARCHER: I'll be right there. Excuse me.
ARCHER: How unstable?
TUCKER: Enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up.
ARCHER: And we're supposed to insulate the entire ship with it?
TUCKER: It's only volatile in it's liquid form. Once we apply it to the  inner hull and it sets, it's completely safe. The tricky part's cooking  it up in the first place.
T'POL: It'll require extremely precise calculations but I believe  Mister Tucker and I can synthesise the compound safely.
ARCHER: Get started.
T'POL: I recommend we set up a lab on E deck, within the emergency  bulkheads, as a precaution.
ARCHER: Come  in.
RAJIIN: Good evening, Captain.
ARCHER: Is everything all right?
RAJIIN: I'm sorry to disturb you. I hoped you might have time to talk.
ARCHER: Er, I'm not quite, er. Please. I meant to speak with you  earlier. We have some good news. T'Pol was able to locate your home  planet in a database we acquired. It's only two days away. You don't  seem very pleased.
RAJIIN: I was taken away when I was very young. I don't remember much  about it, and I doubt anyone there would remember me.
ARCHER: You never know. You seem very memorable to me.
RAJIIN: I'm very grateful for what you've done, Captain. I want to  repay you for your kindness.
ARCHER: That isn't necessary.
RAJIIN: I know.
ARCHER: Rajiin, you
RAJIIN: There's a reason I was taken from my home. I have certain  gifts. Would you like me to show you?
ARCHER: That really isn't something that I
RAJIIN: It's all right.
RAJIIN: Captain, is something wrong?
ARCHER: No.
RAJIIN:  Well, I just wanted to say thank you again.
ARCHER: We'll be leaving orbit soon.
RAJIIN: Good night.
ARCHER: Good night.
TUCKER: What's the molecular pressure?
T'POL: Up to eleven hundred units.
TUCKER: Boy, this stuff is tricky. Decrease the theta bombardment by  six, no, seven percent.
T'POL: The pressure's still rising. Fourteen hundred units. Fourteen  thirty.
TUCKER: Damn it. Kill the theta radiation altogether.
T'POL: No effect. We should seal off this section and leave.
TUCKER: A sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick.
T'POL: It might not. We should evacuate.
TUCKER: I'm going to ramp the delta at eighty percent.
T'POL: It's not working.
TUCKER: You're welcome to leave.
T'POL: The pressure is up to two thousand units. Commander!
T'POL:  Some of our calculations may have been slightly  off.
TUCKER: We're back to square one.
T'POL: We've been working for six hours. I suggest we take a break.
TUCKER: I can't argue with that.
T'POL: Come to my quarters in half an hour. We'll resume your  neuro-pressure regimen.
TUCKER: I'll be fine.
T'POL: I prefer you are rested before we make another attempt.
HOSHI: Can I help you?
RAJIIN: The Captain said it was all right if I left my quarters. I'm  Rajiin.
HOSHI: I know. News travels fast on a starship. I'm Ensign Hoshi Sato.
RAJIIN:  It's a pleasure to meet you. I was  looking for the mess hall.
HOSHI: I just happen to be going that way.
RAJIIN: What's your job here?
HOSHI: I'm the ship's Communications Officer.
RAJIIN: I see.
HOSHI: I'd love to hear your language.
RAJIIN: Actually, I speak quite a few.
RAJIIN: You must be T'Pol. I didn't mean to startle you. My name's  Rajiin.
T'POL: I know who you are. What are you doing here?
RAJIIN: Your door was unlocked.
T'POL: That's not likely.
RAJIIN: I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk.
T'POL: Perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols, but it is  unacceptable for you to be in my quarters uninvited.
RAJIIN: I didn't think you'd mind.
T'POL: I'm afraid
RAJIIN: You're Vulcan, on a ship filled with  humans. Why?
T'POL: Vulcans and humans are allies. Now please leave. What are you  doing?
RAJIIN: Don't resist.
T'POL: I need you to leave.
RAJIIN: You have a disciplined mind. You're in such control of your  emotions. Try to let go. Better.
T'POL: Stop.
RAJIIN: Let go.
T'POL: No!
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge.
CREWWOMAN : Go ahead.
TUCKER: Could you tell me where T'Pol is?
CREWWOMAN : She's in her quarters, sir.
TUCKER: Tucker to Security.
RAJIIN:  I need assistance.
REPTILIAN : Were you successful?
RAJIIN: I have what you want. I can use their transporter device but  you'll need to be within ten thousand kilometres.
REPTILIAN : Signal us when you're ready.
RAJIIN: Is there something wrong?
GUARD: The Captain would like to see you.
RAJIIN: There's no need to bother the Captain.
GUARD: I have my orders.
RAJIIN: So do I.
RAJIIN: Are you in range? Respond.
ARCHER:  Leaving so soon?
ARCHER: We jammed your signal. Your friends can't hear you. Who are they? Take  her to the Brig.
PHLOX: You should let me run a neural scan.
TUCKER: I'll be fine. What happened to her?
PHLOX: I can't even begin to speculate. She's suffered disruptions  throughout her neocortex. If she were human, or Denobulan for that  matter, she'd probably be dead. But Vulcan neurophysiology is a great  deal more resilient than ours.
ARCHER: I want to talk to her.
PHLOX: I have to finish treating her injuries first.
ARCHER: How long?
PHLOX: A few hours.
ARCHER: Have Phlox take a look at your head.
ARCHER: Who were you  trying to contact?
RAJIIN: I'm sorry.
ARCHER: I asked you a question.
RAJIIN: I can't answer it.
ARCHER: What did you do to T'Pol?
RAJIIN: She shouldn't have resisted.
ARCHER:  Who are you?
RAJIIN: I told you. My name is Rajiin.
ARCHER: That's right. Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life  of slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape  when I was at that market. The chemist knew I was looking for  information about the Xindi. Is that why you showed up so conveniently?
RAJIIN: The only thing I can tell you is that you're in danger.
ARCHER: Care to be a little more specific?
RAJIIN: If I say anything else, they'll kill me.
ARCHER: Who, the Xindi? How do you know I won't do the same?
RAJIIN: It's true that I deceived you, but that didn't make your  decision to help me any less admirable. I don't want to see you harmed,  Captain. The best thing for you to do is let me go.
ARCHER: Tell me who you contacted. Who!
REED : Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED : Two vessels are approaching from aft. Sir,
REED: The biosigns match the genetic profile of  the Xindi pilot who attacked Earth.
ARCHER: Hull plating to full power, stand by  weapons. The Reptilian species. They're the ones who sent you.
RAJIIN: I had no choice.
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: I assume they're here for you.
RAJIIN: They won't harm anyone if you let me go.
ARCHER: Forgive me if I don't take your word on that, but they murdered  seven million people on my planet!
REED : Bridge to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED : The smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port.
ARCHER: Seal that airlock and post security teams. I'm on my way.
ARCHER: What was your mission?
RAJIIN: They wanted information.
ARCHER: About what?
RAJIIN: About you. They're building a weapon.
ARCHER: We know that.
RAJIIN: This is different. A bio-weapon.
ARCHER: Go on.
RAJIIN: They need data about your species before they can begin.
ARCHER: Where are they building the weapon?
RAJIIN: I don't know.
ARCHER: When will it be ready?
RAJIIN: I don't know. They didn't tell me anything else.
ARCHER:  Get a security detail down here. No one's taking her  anywhere.
MACO: Fall back!
REED: Three boarding parties, at least five men each.
ARCHER: They're heading for the Brig. Try to cut them off.   You're with me.
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
TRAVIS : Go ahead.
ARCHER: Don't let those ships get away. Lay in a pursuit course.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
MACO: He's dead, sir.
TRAVIS : Captain
TRAVIS: Those ships just entered some kind of  vortex. They're gone.
PHLOX: This gland released a fatal dose of  neuro-toxin into his bloodstream.
TUCKER: What kind of species is born with a suicide gland?
PHLOX: Not this one. He was surgically enhanced, if you can call it an  enhancement.
ARCHER: I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, and have Malcolm take this  weapon apart. I want to find out it's range, power output and how we  can defend against it.
TUCKER: Aye sir.
ARCHER: Are you okay?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Good, because I want an analysis of the scans we took of those  Xindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they went  through. I don't want them dropping in unannounced again. Dismissed.
ARBOREAL: You put all of our work at risk.
HUMANOID: And exposed us to the humans. Allowed one of your soldiers to  be captured.
REPTILIAN: He wasn't taken alive.
DEGRA: You agreed to give me more time. You don't have enough data to  construct the bio-weapon.
REPTILIAN: Don't we? Bring her!
REPTILIAN: Show them. Show  them!
REPTILIAN: We couldn't pursue the bio-weapon  because we didn't have enough information about the humans. Now we do.
AQUATIC: We must proceed on both fronts.
HUMANOID: Do you expect us to reward you for this act of  insubordination? This has left us more vulnerable that we were before.
RAJIIN: There's more to these humans than you can learn from a set of  biometric scans.
REPTILIAN: That's enough! Take her.
