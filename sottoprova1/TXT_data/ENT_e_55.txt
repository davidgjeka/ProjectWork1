ARCHER: She's coming to!
T'POL: Let me go. Let me go!
ARCHER: Stop.
T'POL: I'll kill you.
ARCHER: We're not going to hurt you.
T'POL: You liar! No! Get away from me.
PHLOX: The damage is more severe than I expected.
ARCHER: Can you reverse it?
PHLOX: I'm not certain.
T'POL: What's he doing?
ARCHER: It's all right. He's trying to help you.
T'POL: He's trying to kill me! You killed the others. Murderers! Get  away!
TUCKER:  I talked with Chef at dinner. He's a little worried about the crew.  People are skipping meals. He figures they're either too busy or the  stress of this mission is starting to get to them.
ARCHER: I haven't had much of an appetite myself.
TUCKER: Movie night's been on hold since we entered the Expanse. Maybe  we should start it up again?
ARCHER: There'll be plenty of time for movies after we've dealt with  the Xindi.
TUCKER: No one hates the Xindi more than I do, Captain, but I'm telling  you this crew needs a little R and R. Unless you want Phlox to start  medicating people, we gotta, we've gotta find a way to boost morale.
ARCHER: What did you have in mind?
TUCKER: I was thinking about a comedy. One of the classic Hope and  Crosby pictures.
ARCHER: Good choice.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: We've been reviewing some of these Xindi star charts. Trip  thought they might be able to help us figure out if there are any more  spatial anomalies in the region.
T'POL: I would have helped you do that.
ARCHER: It's late. I didn't want to get you out of bed. Besides, our  resident insomniac was looking for something to do.
TUCKER: You have plans Tuesday night?
T'POL: Not at the moment.
TUCKER: Mess hall, nineteen hundred hours.
T'POL: Movie night?
TUCKER: Back by popular demand.
HOSHI: : Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI:  I'm picking up an automated distress call, sir. It's Vulcan.
ARCHER:  Have you tried hailing them?
HOSHI : Several times.
ARCHER: I'm on my way.
ARCHER:  Where are they?
HOSHI: Three point two light years, bearing oh one six mark twelve.
T'POL: I recognise the transponder frequency. It's the Seleya. They  entered the Expanse nine months ago.
ARCHER: Keep hailing them. Set a course.
T'POL: The asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion. Their paths are  unpredictable. It may be the result of some spatial anomalies.
ARCHER: Where's the Vulcan ship?
T'POL: Approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead.
TUCKER: I can guess why they were interested in this field. The  asteroids are loaded with trellium ore.
ARCHER: It looks a little too crowded in there for Enterprise. Wake up  Mister Reed. Tell him to meet us in the Launch bay.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
ARCHER:  Try to get your hands on some of that ore. T'Pol.
T'POL:  Starboard bow, three hundred forty metres.
ARCHER:
REED: No damage, though we may need a fresh coat of paint.
ARCHER: How much farther?
T'POL: Twelve hundred kilometres. I could take the helm if you'd like.
ARCHER: Maybe on the way back. So what else do you know about the  Seleya?
T'POL: A great deal. I served on it for over a year. It was my last  assignment before joining the consulate on Earth. I was the deputy  science officer under Captain Voris.
ARCHER: Any idea what they were doing in the Expanse?
T'POL: They were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter. After  several days they reported that they'd become caught in some kind of  subspace eddy and were being pulled into the Expanse. It was their  final transmission. The Vankaara was sent to find them. You already  know what happened to that crew.
ARCHER: Let's hope the Seleya fared a little better.
T'POL: Directly ahead, two hundred metres.
ARCHER: Hang on.
TUCKER: Good isotope density. We should get at least half a kilo out of  this one.
TUCKER: Let's try for something bigger  this time. How about this one.
TRAVIS: I've got a lock.
TUCKER: Travis?
TRAVIS: There's an overload in the resequencer.
TUCKER: Shut it down.
TRAVIS: I can't.
TUCKER: This thing's useless. The coils are fused.
TRAVIS: What if I could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones.
TUCKER: They're pretty unpredictable. You sure you could land safely?
TRAVIS: I can try.
TUCKER: This'll be a new one for the maintenance crew.
REED:  Main power's offline. Their hull's taken quite a  beating.
HAWKINS: Life support?
REED: Minimal. Decks twelve and thirteen have decompressed.
T'POL: I'm reading multiple biosigns.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise. Please  respond. Seleya, come in.
T'POL: The starboard docking port is still intact.
REED: Captain. They were lining this bulkhead with trellium. They  didn't get very far.
T'POL: I'm reading biosigns on this deck. I can't isolate them.
ARCHER:  Take starboard.
REED: Vulcan blood.
T'POL: One biosign.
ARCHER: You all right? T'Pol?
T'POL: I'm fine.
T'POL: His synaptic pathways have been  severely damaged.
ARCHER: Let's get him in the pod.
T'POL: Captain!
ARCHER: Keep back!
ARCHER: Archer to Reed.
REED : Go ahead sir.
ARCHER: Have you come across anyone?
REED: Not yet.
ARCHER : Watch yourself. Something's happened to them. They've  become violent.
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Lieutenant, you okay?
REED: What happened to them?
T'POL: Seven more, that direction, thirty metres.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Let's get out of here.
T'POL: What are you doing?
HAWKINS: Stun isn't working. We should set our weapons to kill.
T'POL: These are Vulcan officers and we're on a rescue mission.
HAWKINS: With respect ma'am, they don't seem to want our help.
T'POL: You heard me!
ARCHER: Keep your weapons on stun.
HAWKINS: Yes, sir.
HAWKINS: Captain, over here.
REED: What are they doing?
ARCHER: We're from the Starfleet ship Enterprise. Do you understand me?
ARCHER: Is there another way  to the airlock?
T'POL: No.
T'POL: That way.
ARCHER: Go. Go on.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.  Enterprise respond.
T'POL: If their comm. system's intact we may be able to contact  Enterprise from the Bridge.
ARCHER: Where is it?
T'POL: Seven decks above us.
REED: Seven. How many Vulcans are on board?
T'POL: Assuming the entire crew is still alive, one hundred and forty  seven.
REED: If I'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level. Maybe we can  use one of their shuttles.
T'POL: The bay's depressurised, probably from an asteroid impact.
ARCHER: We have to get back to our pod.
T'POL: That'll be difficult. All four bulkheads leading to the airlock  have been sealed.
ARCHER: We should keep moving. How's your arm?
HAWKINS: It's fine, sir.
REED: He's losing a lot of blood, Captain. We've got to treat this  wound.
ARCHER: How far to their Sickbay?
T'POL: It's two decks up.
ARCHER: Let's go.  Are you all right?
T'POL: Since we've come aboard, I've been experiencing anxiety.  Whatever's happened to this crew may be starting to affect me.
ARCHER: We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
TUCKER: This one's more isolated, and I'm reading large deposits near  the surface. Can you set us down?
TRAVIS: There isn't a flat spot much bigger than my quarters.
TUCKER: You're the pilot, it's your call.
TRAVIS: Let's go. I'm matching the rotational velocity.
TUCKER: Looking good. Two hundred metres. You're drifting to the left.
TRAVIS: Got it.
TRAVIS: I hope you won't write that landing  up in your log.
TUCKER: Are you kidding? I'm going to recommend they give you a medal.
TUCKER:  Let's try to make this quick.
ARCHER: Any idea what's causing this?
T'POL: I'm not a doctor.
ARCHER: But you are my Science Officer. I need to know I can depend on  you.
T'POL: I'll do my best. His name is Solin. When I served here he was  the Chief Engineer. I knew him.
T'POL: Can you understand me?  Sub-Commander T'Pol. We served together. Don't you recognise me? We're  here to help you but we need to know what happened to your crew. Solin,  look at me. Something has made you very ill. You've lost control. Tell  me what happened. Tell me!
T'POL: This is going to  happen to me.
ARCHER: You don't know that.
T'POL: It's already started. I can feel my control slipping away.
ARCHER: We're getting you off this ship.
T'POL: It's too late.
ARCHER: We're going to take the scans you made back to Phlox and figure  out what's going on here, but first we have to get to the shuttle. How  do you open those bulkheads? The bulkheads.
T'POL: There's an auxiliary control room on the Engineering deck.
ARCHER: Okay.
HAWKINS: Are you okay?
ARCHER: T'Pol, we have to keep moving.
T'POL: I don't need your help.
REED: Two more biosigns fifty metres beyond that hatch. It's the only  way to the Engineering deck.
ARCHER: We'll go deal with them. Stay with her, Hawkins.
HAWKINS: Aye sir.
HAWKINS: Water? No offense, but you look like you could use some.
T'POL: Thank you.
HAWKINS: I apologise for the way I reacted before. You were right, this  is a rescue mission. May I ask you a question? How is it possible that  this crew could turn so violent, when Vulcans aren't supposed to have  emotions.
T'POL: A common misconception. We have emotions. We simply keep them  suppressed, under control. Something has obviously caused them to lose  that control.
HAWKINS: Why would they want to kill us?
T'POL: There was a time in the past when we were an extremely violent  race. We nearly destroyed ourselves. Paranoia and homicidal rage were  common.
REED: Five metres.
ARCHER: Any more where they came from?
REED: Not at the moment.
ARCHER: Archer to Hawkins.
HAWKINS: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER : We're all clear.
HAWKINS: Understood. We're on our way.
TRAVIS: I heard about the accident you and T'Pol had in the lab.
TUCKER: It was minor. Nothing to write home about.
TRAVIS: But you're sure this stuff is safe to bring on board?
TUCKER: Don't worry. It only tends to blow up in its liquid state.
HOSHI : Enterprise to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
HOSHI:  Sir, we've just picked up a spatial anomaly at your coordinates.
TUCKER : We saw it.
HOSHI: It's altered the course of
HOSHI  : The asteroid. You're heading into a denser part of the field.
TRAVIS:  Grab a seat, Commander.
TUCKER: Don't worry about me. Just get us the hell out of here.
TRAVIS: The starboard thruster's failing.
TUCKER: There's debris in the intake manifold. Can you purge it?
TRAVIS: We're clear. We've only  got one thruster left.
TUCKER: Can you get us home?
TRAVIS: I think so.
TUCKER: Shuttlepod two to Enterprise.
HOSHI : Go ahead, Commander.
TUCKER: We're on our way back, but we've taken damage.
TUCKER  : Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking.
HOSHI: Understood.
ARCHER: Secure the door.
T'POL: The transceiver's been damaged.
ARCHER: Any chance of repairing it? T'Pol.
T'POL: What!
ARCHER: Any chance of repairing it.
T'POL: There's an auxiliary transmitter. If I can get access to it we  may be able to contact Enterprise.
REED: Sir, I've encrypted the locking codes, but if they're determined  to get in.
TUCKER: Looks like the impulse assembly took a beating. Open up the  engine housings and run a diagnostic.
HOSHI : Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Tucker here.
HOSHI : We're receiving a transmission from the Captain. It sounds  urgent.
TUCKER: Route it down here.
HOSHI : Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER : Trip,
ARCHER:  We're going to need some help getting off this ship. How fast can you  be here?
TUCKER:  Pod two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir. We're looking at a  couple of hours before we can launch again.
TUCKER  : What's the problem?
ARCHER: It's the Vulcan crew. Something's wrong with them.
ARCHER  : We're going to transmit some biodata.
ARCHER:  Tell Phlox to start analysing it. See if there's anything we can do to  help these people.
TUCKER : Acknowledged. Anything else?
ARCHER: Just get that shuttle flying.
TUCKER:  Aye sir.
ARCHER : Archer out.
TUCKER: You heard the Captain. Get a repair team down here.
T'POL:  The bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine. I've rerouted them  through the auxiliary grid. Mister Reed, are you finished with those  actuator circuits?
REED: They've all been realigned.
ARCHER: You okay?
T'POL: What did you do?
REED: I realigned the circuits, just like you asked me.
T'POL: These aren't sequenced correctly. You  overloaded the locking mechanism!
ARCHER: Then we'll have to try something else.
T'POL: It's pointless. The circuits are damaged! I should have been  watching him. You didn't want me to see. Now I know what you were doing  in the Command Centre.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
T'POL: The Xindi starcharts. You were analysing them behind my back,  undermining my work.
ARCHER: No one's trying to sabotage your work. We should all just focus  on getting off this ship safely.
REED: There might be another way, sir. If we overload the power grid,  it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkhead  mechanisms.
T'POL: The warp reactor is unstable as it is. Disrupting main power  could shut down the anti-matter containment. You'd cause a reactor  breach.
ARCHER: I don't think we have much of a choice.
T'POL: You want to kill all of us.  You  don't trust Vulcans. You never have.
REED: Sir, that pistol's set to kill.
ARCHER: Give me the weapon.
T'POL: Don't think I've forgotten. You blamed us for holding you back,  for undermining your father's work. Now you've decided to take revenge.   I'll fire!
ARCHER: Listen to me. This is a rescue mission. We're here to save  these people.
T'POL: You're lying. You want to kill them.
ARCHER: If that's true, then why would I keep our weapons on stun? It's  not logical.
TUCKER:  It doesn't make sense. T'Pol and I have been working with trellium for  weeks. She hasn't shown any symptoms.
PHLOX: I don't imagine she would have. Despite your best efforts, you  weren't able to synthesis it in any significant quantities. The crew of  the Seleya, however, had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid  field filled with the compound. Trellium-D is a potent neurotoxin to  the Vulcan nervous system. It disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow  them to control emotions. Unfortunately the rate of decay is  accelerating.
ARCHER:  Is it too late?
PHLOX : I can treat her, but I nee to begin synaptic regeneration  as soon as possible.
ARCHER: What about the Vulcan crew?
ARCHER: Phlox, do you read me?
PHLOX : I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others.  They've been exposed for too long. The neurological damage is  irreversible. They're dying, Captain.
T'POL: He's lying. He wants them all to die.
ARCHER: Doctor, there are over a hundred and forty people on this ship.
PHLOX : I'm sorry, but they've been exp
ARCHER: Enterprise. Phlox, do you hear me? Respond.
REED: They've shut the comm. system down.
HAWKINS: Captain, they're flooding the compartment with hexafluorine.
ARCHER: Shut it off.
REED: I can't. They've bypassed the environmental controls.
T'POL: They won't let you destroy this ship.
ARCHER: After you initiate the overload, how long do we have?
REED: About fifteen minutes, maybe less.
T'POL: No!
ARCHER: You heard what the Doctor said. They can't be saved, but you  can.
T'POL: Murderer!
ARCHER: Help me get her out of here.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Just about there.
ARCHER:  Come on. Climb!
ARCHER: Malcolm!
REED: We don't have much time.
T'POL: No, no, no.
ARCHER: You can't stay here.
REED: Another twenty metres.
HAWKINS: Captain!
REED: How were you at the long jump.
ARCHER: Watch her. Reed.
ARCHER: Come on, you can make it.
T'POL: Get away from me.
ARCHER: It's okay, I'll help you.
T'POL: Touch me and I'll kill you.
REED: Go. I said, go!
HAWKINS: Give me a hand.
REED:  What's wrong?
ARCHER: I can't release the docking clamps. Full power to thrusters.
HAWKINS: We're being hailed.
TUCKER:  Are you all right, Captain?
ARCHER : The docking
ARCHER:  clamps are jammed. We could use a hand.
TUCKER : Stand by.
TUCKER : You're clear, sir.
ARCHER: The ship's about to blow. Get the hell out of here.
ARCHER: Archer to shuttlepod two. Are you still in one piece?
TUCKER : We're fine, sir. See you back on Enterprise.
TUCKER:  We got over
ARCHER: It may be a while before Phlox finds a way to inoculate T'Pol.  Take this to Cargo bay one. Store it in the biohazard locker.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: How'd it go?
PHLOX: You got her out in time, Captain. Her synaptic pathways are  mending nicely, but it will be a few days before she fully regains  control of her emotions.
ARCHER: I'd like to talk with her.
ARCHER: Phlox was able to help you. You're going to be okay.
T'POL: The Seleya?
ARCHER: It was destroyed. I'm sorry, but I didn't have a choice.
PHLOX: They were beyond help. Their fate was sealed long before we  arrived.  Please don't be long. 
T'POL: Was Commander Tucker successful?
ARCHER: Yes and no. He collected a good supply of trellium, but it  turns out it was trellium that poisoned the Vulcan crew and you.
T'POL: It's essential you protect this ship. Leave me on the next  habitable planet.
ARCHER: I'm not going to do that.
T'POL: You can't allow your concern for a single crewman to affect your  mission. This Expanse destroyed everyone aboard the Seleya. Don't let  it happen to Enterprise.
ARCHER: We'll find a way through this, but I won't leave anyone behind.  Not if I can help it. I can't try to save humanity without holding on  to what makes me human.
PHLOX: Something tells me we haven't seen the last of the detective in  the bow tie.
TUCKER: No, he died in a house fire.
PHLOX: Ah, did he? The autopsy was inconclusive. I wouldn't be  surprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strange  limp. You never did see him leave the house.
TUCKER: What about the gardener? He was there too.
PHLOX: Too tall. Even the primitive forensics of the mid-twentieth  century would have determined that.
T'POL: Perhaps we should watch, and find out.
TUCKER: Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it  ends, using logic. You of all people should appreciate that.
T'POL: Then use logic more quietly.
ARCHER : All hands report to stations. Tactical alert.
PHLOX: It's all right. You're on Enterprise. You're safe.
