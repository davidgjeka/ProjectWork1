ARCHER: Did you get that?
HOSHI: Tostka. Insult. Some kind of an insult.
T'POL: He's insulting us or we insulted them?
HOSHI: I'm not sure.
CAPTAIN: Tostka!
ARCHER: Ask what we did wrong.
HOSHI: Kjass. Skjask las?
CAPTAIN: Hwajat ajhakjahs!
ARCHER: Well?
HOSHI: You eat like you mate?
TUCKER: You sure that thing's working?
CAPTAIN: Sasooratt!
HOSHI: I think they want to leave.
T'POL: That much is obvious.
ARCHER: Whatever we've done to offend you, I apologize.
HOSHI: Jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii.
CAPTAIN: Sasooratt!
TUCKER:  Well, this is one for the books. Briefest First Contact.
HOSHI: Does anybody hear that?
TRAVIS: What, the static?
HOSHI: Frequency distortions mixed in with the static.
TRAVIS: You've got better ears than we do.
HOSHI: It's coming from the comm. system.
T'POL: Have you run a diagnostic?
HOSHI: Twice. I guess today is just not my day.
TRAVIS: How's the translation coming along?
HOSHI: Slowly. Hwajat, their word for eat.
TRAVIS: What about it?
HOSHI: With the emphasis on the first syllable, hwa-jat, it means to  mate.
TRAVIS: I can see how that might cause some confusion over dinner.
HOSHI: Context is critical in every language but Kreetassan has the  most subtle variations I've ever seen. The same word can have a dozen  different meanings.
T'POL: We rely on you to recognise the difference, Ensign.
HOSHI: You think it was my fault?
T'POL: I didn't say that.
HOSHI: You implied it.
T'POL: I simply noted that linguistic matters fall within your  responsibility. For all we know it was Mister Tucker's table manners  that offended them.
HOSHI: But you think if I picked up the language faster they might have  not stormed off the ship.
T'POL: There's no need to react emotionally. Try to learn from failure.  It could help your next first contact be more successful.
HOSHI: Thanks.
HOSHI: Commander, I'm picking up  some kind of interference from the comm. system. A high-frequency  distortion.
TUCKER: Is it a problem?
HOSHI: Mostly just irritating.
TUCKER: I'll track it down first thing in the morning.
HOSHI: Thanks.
TUCKER: Is he in there?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: How's his mood?
T'POL: Now might not be the best time.
TUCKER: I'll take my chances.
ARCHER: It better be  important.
TUCKER: Prime rib tonight with real horseradish.
ARCHER: Thanks. I'll have the steward send some up. Thought we'd set a  course for this brown dwarf system. Looks interesting.
TUCKER: I can't wait. In the meantime, why don't we shoot a little nine  ball? You can break.
ARCHER: Maybe later.
TUCKER: I was going to save this for a rainy day, but
TUCKER: Stanford versus Texas.
ARCHER: The finals?
TUCKER: Fresh out of the subspace mailbag. You've been threatening to  teach me the finer points of the game.
TUCKER: Unless  you're too busy with your brown dwarves.
TRAVIS: What if they just don't like being touched? Remember how  uncomfortable they looked when the Captain tried to shake their hands?
REED: They looked that way the entire time. Besides, they didn't really  lose their temper until they arrived here in the mess hall.
TRAVIS: Are you staying for the movie tonight?
REED: What's playing?
TRAVIS:
REED: Oh, sounds fun. Hoshi?
HOSHI: No, thanks. I'm turning in early.
REED: We might need a translator. Those subtitles go by pretty fast.
HOSHI: I've had enough language problems for one day.
ROSTOV: We're going to have to sit in the back.
KELLY: One minute.
ROSTOV: I hate missing the beginning.
KELLY: It's on the computer. You can watch it whenever you want.
ROSTOV: It's not the same. You don't want to go back and see the first  part after you know how it ends.
KELLY: The power just went out on D deck. Cargo bay two. The lighting  grid's down.
ROSTOV: It's probably just a blown relay. Leave it for the night shift.
KELLY: If it's just a blown relay it'll take you ten minutes to fix.  Here.
KELLY: The comm.'s out too.
REED: Two and a half hours?
TRAVIS: Two hours and twenty four minutes.
REED: Seems awfully long for a movie about four men in a truck.
TRAVIS: You'll be on the edge of your seat.
REED: You promised me explosions.
TRAVIS: Don't worry.
REED: This is all wrong.  Excuse me. Reed to Bridge.
VOICE : Go ahead, Lieutenant.
REED: We're trying to watch a movie down here but instead, we're being  treated to a view of you. So unless you're planning on giving us a  little song and dance, maybe you could see what's gone wrong.
ARCHER: Come on, come on. Goal for Stanford!
TUCKER: How deep's the pool?
ARCHER: Deep enough so that no one can touch the bottom.
TUCKER: I didn't know it was such a rough game.
ARCHER: Think of it as one part basketball one part swimming and one  part wrestling.
TUCKER: And I thought it was just a bunch of guys screwing around in a  pool.
KELLY: Engineering.  Michael, is that  you? Hello?
ARCHER: Nice goal!
TUCKER: Did you see the way number twelve set him up? Wait, he's called  the point man, right?
ARCHER: Very good. I told you, best sport in the world.
TUCKER: Well, I'll still take a great off-tackle run out of the  backfield, but I can see how you can get hooked on this.
ARCHER: Thanks for thinking of it.
TUCKER: My pleasure. Now keep watching while Texas trounces your sorry  California butts.
ARCHER: You haven't watched the end of this, have you?
TUCKER: Of course not.
KELLY: Hello?
TUCKER: What the hell was that?
ARCHER: Oh, number eight on Texas just fouled one of my boys. He's  going to be ejected for twenty seconds.
TUCKER: Is that fair? It gives you guys an advantage.
ARCHER: Well, that's the point. I don't suppose it'd be practical to  put a pool on the ship.
TUCKER: I wouldn't want to be taking a swim if the gravity plating went  offline.
ARCHER: No. No.
KELLY : Kelly to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
KELLY : Sir, I'm in Cargo bay two and
KELLY: There's some kind of lifeform in here.
ARCHER: Lifeform?
KELLY : It's got Rostov, sir. He's still conscious, but he can't
ARCHER: Crewman?
ARCHER: Weapons to stun.
REED: Captain.
TUCKER: Sir?
REED: Careful.
ARCHER: The light.
REED:  She's alive.
ROSTOV:  Captain? Leave.
ARCHER: Crewman?
ROSTOV: Leave.
REED: Captain!
TUCKER: Get out of here! Go!
REED: This thing appears to be growing. There's no  telling if it'll get out of the cargo bay. I recommend we evacuate the  entire deck.
HOSHI: How did it get onboard?
TRAVIS: The last time we opened the airlock, we were docked with the  Kreetassans.
REED: You think they left us a little souvenir?
T'POL: Our encounter didn't go well but I doubt we gave them reason to  attack us. We're not even certain that the organism's hostile.
REED: You didn't see that thing go after the Captain! It seemed hostile  enough to me.
TRAVIS: The Kreetassans might know something about this thing. I can  start scanning for their ship, try to pick up their warp trail.
T'POL: We'll need to communicate with them better than last time.
HOSHI: I'll do my best.
T'POL: T'Pol to Doctor Phlox. Report.
PHLOX : I'm preparing to examine the specimen. Would you care to  observe?
T'POL: Yes. Stand by.
PHLOX : You'll note that even though it's been severed from  its body, it survives independently
PHLOX: Not unlike the  common earthworm or the Neethian cradlefish.
REED: Do you think that's wise, Doctor?
PHLOX: Possibly not, but  I'm going to need a tissue sample if I hope to learn more about its  physiology.
PHLOX: That'll be  quite enough. This is no earthworm.
T'POL: Doctor?
PHLOX : Look at the synaptic activity. This organism possesses a  very sophisticated nervous system. It could be capable of higher mental  functions.
HOSHI: If it's intelligent maybe we can communicate with it. The  frequency distortions, they look a lot like the phonetic patterns in  certain Andorian dialects.
REED: With all due respect, Hoshi, we're not talking about nouns and  verbs here. It could take you days to learn a language like that, even  if it is one.
HOSHI: What other choice do we have? Give me a chance.
T'POL: I'm sorry, Ensign, there isn't enough time.
HOSHI: Sub-Commander.
T'POL: We need to neutralise it, quickly. You said phase pistols had no  effect?
REED: None that I could tell.
T'POL: Then I suggest you find a method that does.
PHLOX : If I may, the organism is highly photo-sensitive. A  sustained burst of EM radiation might be enough to stun the creature.
T'POL: Can you assemble some EM emitters?
REED: It'll take a few minutes.
ROSTOV: Why doesn't it just kill us?
TUCKER: Take it easy.
ARCHER: I'm sure T'Pol and Malcolm are doing everything they can to get  us out of here. Can either of you see Crewman Kelly?
ROSTOV: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: How's she look?
ROSTOV: She's still breathing.
TUCKER: Zabel's still unconscious.
ROSTOV: Captain?
ARCHER: Yeah.
ROSTOV: I imagine in a situation like this they'd cancel the movie.
ARCHER: I imagine so.
ROSTOV: I really wanted to see it. Yves Montand driving explosives  through the mountains.
ARCHER: I'll make sure they reschedule it for next week.
ROSTOV: Thank you, sir.
PHLOX: It's working.
REED: Bridge, something's wrong.
PHLOX: Shut off the emitters.
REED : Doctor?
PHLOX: Shut them off.
REED: Off.
T'POL: What happened?
PHLOX: Their nervous systems appear to be linked to the organism's.  They're sharing autonomic functions, neural impulses. If we continue  firing we could end up killing our own people.
T'POL: Mister Reed, withdraw your team.
REED: Understood.
PHLOX: The rate of symbiosis is increasing. If we  don't find a way to extract them soon their systems will be too  integrated with the creature. I won't be able to separate them.
T'POL:  You wanted a chance to communicate. I suggest you  begin.
T'POL: How much time do they have?
PHLOX: A few hours at most. Their metabolic rates are dropping.  Temperature, respiration.
REED: There must be some way to cut them out of there.
PHLOX: I'm not sure if you appreciate how alien this creature is. It's  not attacking our crewmen, it's trying to integrate them into itself.
REED: The end result's the same.
PHLOX: At some point in the very near future there won't be six  lifeforms in that cargo bay. There'll only be one.
REED: If that thing continues to grow, we're going  to have to find a way to contain it.
T'POL: Do you have a suggestion?
REED: Starfleet's been working on creating a stable EM barrier for the  last five years.
T'POL: A force field.
REED: Right. They just haven't found a way to control the particle  density. All the specs are in the database. I've been trying to  jerry-rig a prototype of my own.
T'POL: And?
REED: I've got it stable enough to absorb a phase pistol blast sixty  percent of the time. I think I can improve on that.
T'POL: I suggest you work quickly.
TRAVIS: I think I found them.
T'POL: Where?
TRAVIS: Point five two light years from here.
T'POL: Lay in a course.
TRAVIS: I already have. I've been sending out hails but we're still out  of comm. range.
T'POL: Let me know as soon as they respond.
T'POL: Any progress?
HOSHI: Believe me, you'd be the first to know. I'm sorry. It's  frustrating. I'm not having a lot of luck.
T'POL: The situation requires expertise, not luck.
HOSHI: Maybe I don't have the expertise.
T'POL: If you don't, no one else aboard Enterprise does.
HOSHI: I'm doing my best.
T'POL: It was your suggestion that we attempt to communicate with it.  If you don't think that's possible, we'll have to find another  solution.
HOSHI: I've made a little progress, but our translation matrix isn't  designed for this. Look at it. It's more like a calculus equation than  a language.
T'POL: Mathematics is sometimes considered a form of language.
HOSHI: What I'm trying to say is that I could use help from someone  with a background in higher mathematics.
T'POL: Perhaps I can assist you.
TUCKER: The Texas goalie can't block to his right  because he keeps his hands too deep.
ARCHER: How do you know that?
ROSTOV: Captain, I know it too, and I don't understand anything about  water polo.
ARCHER: It's this lifeform. It's linking us together somehow.
TUCKER: We got to get out!
ARCHER: Calm down.
TUCKER: This thing's gotten inside our heads!
ARCHER: Trip, do you know what I'm thinking about?
TUCKER: Now's not the time to be thinking about the regionals.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Senior year, North American regionals against Princeton. We, I  mean, you were down by two goals under a minute left.
ARCHER: And what was I thinking? What was I thinking.
TUCKER: You thought you could win every game. You always thought you  could win. No matter how far behind you were.
ARCHER: And we did. We went on the finals that year. As soon as you  give up, the game's lost.
REED: How's our little friend?
PHLOX: Fast asleep. It appears to have entered a dormant state.  Probably a reaction to the shock of being severed from the larger  organism.
REED: But it's alive?
PHLOX: Very much so.
REED: Good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to run a few tests of my  own.
PHLOX: What kind of tests?
REED: I need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate.
PHLOX: May I ask why?
REED: I'm trying to create a force field to isolate the cargo bay, but  if it's going to work, I have to calculate how much of a jolt it will  take to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people it's  taken.
PHLOX: If you intend to pummel this appendage with EM radiation until  it cries for mercy, I'm afraid I can't permit that.
REED: Why not?
PHLOX: This is more than just a severed limb. It exhibits all the signs  of an intelligent being.
REED: Intelligent being or not, its big brother is in the Cargo bay  strangling the Captain and four other crewmen. If we don't do something  to contain it now it could pose a threat to everyone on board.
PHLOX: There are less invasive ways to gather the information you need.
REED: Such as?
PHLOX: Microcellular analysis.
REED: How long would that take?
PHLOX: Less than an hour.
REED: In less than an hour that thing could spread across half a deck.
PHLOX: I'm willing to help you, Mister Reed, but not if it means  torturing this organism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't our mission  to try to better understand unique forms of life?
REED: Not if they're trying to kill the Captain.
PHLOX: We don't know anything about this creature's intentions.
REED: I admire your interspecies ethics, but until Hoshi tells me she's  found a way to communicate with it, I have to assume its intentions are  hostile. Now, if you don't mind.
PHLOX: If you want information to help you construct your force field,  you'll acquire it under my supervision.
REED: I'm sure I don't have to remind you, Doctor, I am the ranking  officer here.
PHLOX: Not in my Sickbay, unless the Captain says otherwise.
REED: The Captain is in no condition to offer an opinion.
PHLOX: Precisely.
REED: Fine. Your rules, but we'd better get to it.
T'POL: What if we used a bilateral algorithm?
HOSHI: I already tried.
T'POL: Did you compensate for frequency drift?
HOSHI: I wouldn't be much of a comm. officer if I didn't.
T'POL: Allowing your emotions to control you won't help solve this  problem, Ensign.
HOSHI: Neither will questioning everything I do.
T'POL: You asked for my help.
HOSHI: I didn't ask for you to keep count of every time I make a  mistake, or to second-guess all of my decisions.
T'POL: As First Officer it's my duty to supervise you.
HOSHI: This goes beyond duty, Sub-Commander. You've been looking over  my shoulder ever since you came on board. Double-checking my log  entries, my translations.
T'POL: It's my job.
HOSHI: Is that all we're talking about? You don't think I belong on  Enterprise, do you.
T'POL: On the contrary. It would be a great loss to Starfleet if you  were not a part of this crew. If you feel I've been unfair to you, I  apologise, but I hold you to a high standard, Ensign, because I know  you're capable of achieving it. Shall we continue?
HOSHI: Yes. Why don't we take another look at the sub-harmonics. I was  thinking we could run it through the decryption matrix, see if we can  find a pattern. All I see is numbers, codes.
T'POL: Any code can be broken.
TRAVIS: You speak English.
CAPTAIN : We studied your database. It wasn't difficult.
TRAVIS: Okay. We have a problem.
CAPTAIN : Yes?
TRAVIS: There'an alien organism on our ship.
CAPTAIN : Yes?
TRAVIS: It came aboard around the same time we saw you. We were hoping  you might know something about it.
CAPTAIN : Describe this organism.
TRAVIS: Well, it's big, but it didn't start out that way. It's like a  large mass of tendrils.
CAPTAIN : Tendrils?
TRAVIS: Like a giant web, but it moves and grows.
CAPTAIN : We have seen this.
TRAVIS: Where?
CAPTAIN: On its home world. Perhaps it attached itself to our ship. It  wasn't our fault.
TRAVIS: Can you tell us where this planet is?
CAPTAIN : Apologise.
TRAVIS: Excuse me?
CAPTAIN : We will send you the coordinates but first  you must apologise to us for your offence.
TRAVIS: That's the thing. We don't know what we did to offend you.
CAPTAIN : On your ship, you put food in your mouths.
TRAVIS: You mean eat.
CAPTAIN : Yes. Eat.
TRAVIS: I don't understand.
CAPTAIN : It is like mating. It is very offensive to us.
TRAVIS: We were just eating. How do you eat?
CAPTAIN : We eat the same way, but not in the presence  of others.
TRAVIS: I see. Okay. Please believe me, we had no idea that would be  offensive to you. It was simply a misunderstanding. On behalf of the  entire crew, I sincerely apologise.
CAPTAIN : Your apology is accepted.
TRAVIS: Thank you. Now, could I have those coordinates?
TUCKER: Captain.
ARCHER: Yeah.
TUCKER: I feel you've drifted away over there.
ARCHER: You aren't feeling much better than I do. Rostov?
TUCKER: He's out. When Zephram Cochrane talked about new life and new  civilisation do you think this is what he meant?
HOSHI: Here, here it is. I found a third set of  repetitions. Try it. Just a few more and the UT can start building a  syntax.
PHLOX : Phlox to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
PHLOX : I know you're under a great deal of pressure
PHLOX: But Crewman Kelly's metabolic rate has  dropped to a critical level. Whatever you're planning to do
PHLOX : You'd better do it soon.
T'POL: Understood.
CREWMAN: Ready, sir.
REED: The particle density's still fluctuating. I think the problem's  in the lower left quadrant.
CREWMAN : Got it, sir.
REED: Try again.
REED: Better.
T'POL : T'Pol to Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Go ahead.
T'POL : We've made some progress on the translation, but we're  going to need to get into the cargo bay to test it. Is the forcefield  ready?
REED: I'm making the final calibrations now.
T'POL : You'll have to do it quickly. Doctor Phlox says our people  don't have much time.
REED: Understood.
TUCKER: Captain?
REED: Emitter B's off by three point two microns.
REED: The forcefield's working, but I can't  guarantee how long it will hold. Have you done it?
T'POL: We're about to find out.
REED: It just sounds like a constant tone.
HOSHI: I'm going to create distortions in the tone. Hopefully, the  organism will understand what I'm trying to do.
HOSHI: Come on, just a  little more. I think I've got enough to try something simple.
T'POL: Ask what it wants.
HOSHI: It's talking to us.
T'POL: What's it saying? Ensign.
HOSHI: Hold on. It's giving us coordinates.
REED: Its home world?
T'POL: The Kreetassans already gave them to us.
HOSHI: These look more like the latitude and longitude. I think it's  trying to give us an exact location of the planet.
T'POL: Tell it we're taking it back.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker's heart rate is increasing.
REED: Is that good or bad?
PHLOX: Good. Crewman Kelly's biosigns are stabilising as well.
T'POL: Lower the force field. Lieutenant.
PHLOX: Medical Team, report to Cargo bay two.
CREWWOMAN : Acknowledged.
T'POL: Here.
HOSHI: Look at all of them.
T'POL: Not them, it. This is all one organism.
REED: The part that got on board, why did it take our people?
PHLOX: Hard to say. When it got separated from itself, perhaps it  needed a physical connection with any lifeform it could find.
