KIRK: Status, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course  and on schedule.
KIRK: It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock?
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency!
MCCOY: Jim, choriocytosis is a strange disease. In  races with iron-based blood, it's practically nothing, but in others
KIRK: Get to the point, Bones.
MCCOY: Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans.
KIRK: Are you sure?
MCCOY: I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's  blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and  encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen.
KIRK: The result is suffocation.
MCCOY: Yes, Jim.
KIRK: Is there any cure?
MCCOY: One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only  found on a few planets in the galaxy.
KIRK: Library computer.
COMPUTER: Working.
KIRK: What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present  position?
COMPUTER: Beta Canopus. Four solar days away at maximum warp.
KIRK: How long can Spock last without the drug?
MCCOY: I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow  the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It  loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will  be irreversible.
KIRK: It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in  three. There's got to be a way.
MCCOY: What about a rendezvous?
KIRK: Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time,  there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get  me Starfleet, Lieutenant.
KIRK: What will the symptoms be, Bones?
MCCOY: Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the  symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the  test you had to pass back at the Academy.
KIRK: Come.
SPOCK: You wished to see me, sir?
KIRK: Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the  drug you need.
SPOCK: I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five.
KIRK: No, it won't.
SPOCK: Will that be all, Captain?
KIRK: One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half.
SPOCK: Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able
MCCOY: No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders.
SPOCK: Anything else, sir?
KIRK: That's all, Spock. Dismissed.
KIRK: It'll hurt seeing him like that.
MCCOY: I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand  that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to  him.
NUMBER ONE:  ETA at rendezvous point, two hours and seven  minutes, Captain.
O'SHEA: Good. That's a pretty important drug we've got for the  Enterprise. I'd just as soon get rid of it and get back to shipping  just dilithium.
HELMSMAN: Sir, our sensors are picking up a ship ahead.
O'SHEA: Could the Enterprise be that early?
HELMSMAN: I'm not sure it's the Enterprise, sir. It's too far away to  tell.
O'SHEA: Where's it headed?
HELMSMAN: Toward us, sir.
O'SHEA: Keep an eye on it, Lieutenant.
KIRK: Time to rendezvous, Mister Arex?
AREX: One hour forty three minutes, sir.
KIRK: I hate to ask, but
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. We'll squeeze a wee bit more speed out of her.
MCCOY : McCoy to Bridge.
KIRK: What is it, Bones?
MCCOY : Tell Spock it's time for another shot.
KIRK: Mister Spock. Spock.
SPOCK: I was conserving energy, Captain.
KIRK: McCoy wants you in Sickbay.
HELMSMAN: Sensor readout, Captain. It's not the  Enterprise closing on us, sir.
O'SHEA: Another starship?
HELMSMAN: No, sir. It's an alien ship, a design I've never seen before.
O'SHEA: Put it on the screen.
O'SHEA: You're sure it's following us?
NUMBER ONE: It's on an intercept course now, Captain. And at this  speed, they'll get us before we get to the Enterprise.
MCCOY: This won't hurt a bit, Spock.
SPOCK: An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue.
MCCOY: That's the last time I waste my bedside manner on a Vulcan.
SPOCK: Such restraint would be welcome.
MCCOY: Not so fast, Spock. Lie there quietly.
MCCOY: Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor.
CHAPEL: The drug isn't working any more.
MCCOY: I know, Christine. I know. Don't worry, we'll have the strobolin  soon.
HELMSMAN: They've increased speed, sir, closing  fast.
O'SHEA: Open hailing frequencies again.
NUMBER ONE: Open, sir.
O'SHEA: To unidentified alien vessel. This is Captain O'Shea of the SS  Huron. Please state your registry and purpose. Repeat. Please identify  yourself and your purpose.
NUMBER ONE: It's no use, sir. They're receiving but they're not  answering.
O'SHEA: Well, we've got a hold full of dilithium and that drug to  protect. Evasive manoeuvres.
HELMSMAN: No good, Captain. Send out an emergency signal to the  Enterprise.
NUMBER ONE: Yes, sir. Message from the alien, sir.
O'SHEA: Let's hear it.
ORION : Prepare to surrender your cargo or be destroyed.
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting a signal from the  Huron. It's an emergency beacon, automated.
KIRK: Try ship to ship.
UHURA: I did, sir. No response.
KIRK: Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point?
SPOCK: No, sir. They hadn't reached it.
KIRK: Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on.
SPOCK: The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support,  Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris.
KIRK: Was the Huron attacked?
SPOCK: Based on present data, I would say yes.
KIRK: Spock, are you all right?
SPOCK: Captain, I 
UHURA: Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency.
MCCOY: We've got to have that drug, Jim. The  synthetic is useless now.
KIRK: Do what you can, Bones.
MCCOY: Blasted Vulcan. Why couldn't you have red blood like any normal  human?
KIRK: Status?
AREX:  The Huron's engines are dead. Emergency  battery power is operating life support systems at a low but acceptable  level.
UHURA: Still unable to make contact, sir.
KIRK: Is anyone on that ship alive?
AREX: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Mister Scott, Lieutenant Uhura, come with me. Mister Sulu, you  have the conn. We're beaming over.
KIRK: Scotty, check the cargo hold. See if the drug is there.
SCOTT: Aye, sir. 
KIRK: Uhura, see if you can get a playback of the log. I want to know  what happened here. Nurse, attend to the wounded.
SCOTT: Scott to Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here. Report, Mister Scott.
SCOTT : There's nothing down here, Captain.
KIRK: No drug?
SCOTT: No drug and no dilithium shipment. The hold  is completely empty.
KIRK: All right. Report back up here.
UHURA: This screen is out, sir. But we can take the tapes and play them  back on the Enterprise.
KIRK: Good. Nurse, how is he?
CHAPEL: He needs surgery, Captain, but he'll live.
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Ready to beam over. Have the medical team  standing by.
KIRK: How's O'Shea, Bones?
MCCOY: He'll pull through. Jim, what about Spock? If we don't have that  drug in twenty hours, he'll die.
AREX: I've run the Huron's sensor tapes through  the computer, sir. The intruder ship is a new design, never before  encountered by Federation shipping.
KIRK: Can we track it?
AREX: Yes, sir. The intruder ship produces a unique trail of  radioactive waste, now bearing two one two degrees mark one seven five.
KIRK: Lay in that course, Sulu. Ahead warp factor seven.
KIRK: How is he, Bones?
MCCOY: Not good, Jim. I'll have to put a respirator on him to help him  breathe soon.
KIRK: We're following the intruder ship's trail.
MCCOY: We don't even know it it's the right one.
KIRK: It's got to be.
MCCOY: What's the use of being a doctor, anyway? We're only as good as  our drugs and technology make us. Underneath all the tricks, I might as  well be practising in the Middle Ages.
KIRK: If you really believed that, Bones, you wouldn't still be a  doctor after twenty five years.
KIRK: Report.
SULU: Radioactive residue still bearing two one two degrees mark one  seven five.
KIRK: Increase speed to warp eight.
SULU: The trail goes through the asteroid belt, Captain.
KIRK: A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister  Sulu?
SULU: Perfect. And a long range sensor can show that the radioactive  residue stops in the middle of the belt.
KIRK: Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one.
KIRK: What was that?
AREX: These asteroids are composed of a highly unstable mineral  combination, sir. They explode upon impact with each other.
KIRK: Or anything else. Keep those deflectors up, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Captain, if the power of those rocks could be harnessed, they'd  make a fantastic source of energy.
KIRK: Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu.
SCOTT: Deflectors holding, sir.
KIRK: Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on.
KIRK: Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu?
SULU: Standard phasers, sir. Weak, though. A diffused, low quality  beam. Our deflectors can stop them.
AREX: I recognise the ship's markings, Captain. It's an Orion.
KIRK: Orion.
UHURA: They're hailing us, Captain.
KIRK: Put it on visual, Lieutenant.
ORION : Enterprise, we demand that you cease your  pursuit immediately. I must protest, as a representative of a neutral  planet.
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to  fire your phasers.
ORION : We couldn't be sure you were non-hostile.
KIRK: Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair  regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate  3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this  quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we  require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply.
ORION : We have no Federation cargo aboard. Orions are  not thieves. If you don't cease this harassment, we will lodge a formal  protest with your government.
KIRK: Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by.
SULU: Sensors picking up the dilithium in their hold, sir.
KIRK: What about the drug?
SULU: If they have it, it's too small an amount to detect.
KIRK: Uhura, open the channel.
UHURA: Channel open, sir.
KIRK: Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do  have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we  desperately need.
ORION: What would these drugs be worth to you if  we had them?
KIRK : You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of  the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional  galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the  drug.
ORION: We get what we want, plus our neutrality remains intact? We will  consider your offer.
KIRK : Very well. Kirk out.
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay.
MCCOY : McCoy here.
KIRK: Bones, how much time?
MCCOY : Less than an hour, Jim. His body functions are slipping  fast now.
KIRK: Just hold out a little longer.
UHURA: The Orions are hailing us, sir.
KIRK: Put it on the screen, Lieutenant.
ORION : Your proposal requires us to trust you. It's  obvious we can't.
KIRK: Do you have a counterproposal?
ORION : Yes. A face to face exchange between you and me.
KIRK: Face to face? Where?
ORION: On the large asteroid near our ships. We  could beam down simultaneously, and I would hand you the drug myself.  You wouldn't even have to give us the extra dilithium crystals. Now  it's your turn to consider.
MCCOY: It's got to be a trap, Jim.
SCOTT: No doubt of it, sir.
KIRK: It could be a trap, but it's the only way to get the drug. And  Spock will die if we don't.
MCCOY: You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim.
KIRK: Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator  channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked  on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you.
MCCOY: If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock.
KIRK: If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance.
ORION: Status, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT: We can't outshoot the Enterprise and we can't outrun it,  sir.
ORION: You're saying we can't escape?
LIEUTENANT: No, sir, we can't.
ORION: Orion's official neutrality comes before this ship or its crew.  We can't take Kirk's word that he won't report this incident to  Starfleet.
LIEUTENANT: The only way to do that is to destroy the Enterprise, and  the only way to do that is to destroy ourselves, too.
ORION: Do you have a plan, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. These asteroids are made of highly explosive  minerals.
ORION: Can we convert the asteroid we're orbiting into a doomsday bomb  that will destroy both ships?
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir, but
ORION: But what?
LIEUTENANT: Analysis of the asteroid shows that it can't be detonated  by our phasers.
ORION: What will it take?
LIEUTENANT: A powerful explosive right on the asteroid's surface. I  could rig a remote control device.
ORION: No. I'll take it with me when I beam down to meet Captain Kirk.  I want the satisfaction of seeing his face when I tell him he and his  crew are going to die with us. And I'm sure they don't trust us. If  Kirk and I are on the asteroid, the Enterprise will stay close by.
LIEUTENANT: Very well, sir. I'll get to work.
KIRK: Enterprise to Orion vessel.
ORION : What is your answer, Captain?
KIRK: I accept your terms.
ORION : Very well. We will synchronise co-ordinates and beam down  in fifteen minutes.
MCCOY: Jim, we don't have a lot of time. Spock
ORION : Fifteen minutes or not at all, Captain.
KIRK: All right. Kirk out.
ORION: The drug, as promised, Captain. Scan it if you wish.
KIRK : Pure strobolin. I'll take that now and  we can both beam up.
ORION: No, Captain. I can't trust that you won't  report this incident to Starfleet. If you do, my planet will lose its  neutrality and be subject to Federation retaliation.
KIRK: You can't escape the Enterprise.
ORION: But we can destroy it.
AREX: Picking up unusual sensor readings, Mister  Scott.
SCOTT: What is it?
AREX: There's dilithium down there with them, sir.
ORION: I have an explosive device in my backpack  that will start a molecular chain reaction and detonate this asteroid.  Your ship will be destroyed.
KIRK: But so will yours.
ORION: All unsuccessful Orion missions end in suicide.
SCOTT: The dilithium. Transporter room, pinpoint  those crystals down there and beam them up!
CHIEF: Pinpointed, Mister Scott.
SCOTT : Beam them up now, lad.
KIRK: Scotty, energise.
SCOTT: Captain, it was close.
KIRK: Let's get up to the Bridge.
ENSIGN: They're gone, sir.
LIEUTENANT: Gone?
ENSIGN: I was scanning as you ordered, and they just disappeared off  the asteroid. Both the Earther and the Captain.
LIEUTENANT: He's been captured, no doubt. Arm our self-destruct system,  Ensign.
KIRK: Open hailing frequencies, Uhura.
KIRK: Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct,  Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not  going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still  stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over.
UHURA: I have the Orion vessel, sir.
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. We have your captain as prisoner. Your  choice, sir.
ORION: Disarm the self-destruct system. Prepare to surrender to the  Enterprise.
MCCOY: Spock, there's no way you can deny it.
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, I
MCCOY: I've waited a long time for this, and you're not going to cheat  me.
KIRK: Am I interrupting something?
SPOCK: Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating.
MCCOY: Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but  this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it.
SPOCK: I still prefer my physiological structure to yours.
KIRK: Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal.
MCCOY: He's as stubborn as ever.
